0;1;7;Before a Fall;peasant;[man] Where would you be headin', little thief?
1;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;Skellige.
2;1;7;Before a Fall;peasant;[man] Hmm.
3;1;7;Before a Fall;;[horse neighs]
4;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;Do you know how long it is to the coast?
5;1;7;Before a Fall;peasant;With a fast horse,
6;1;7;Before a Fall;peasant;about a week.
7;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;And what about by foot?
8;1;7;Before a Fall;;[chuckles]
9;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;You need to be careful, child.
10;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;This place isn't safe if you're alone.
11;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;Then it's the same as every other place.
12;1;7;Before a Fall;;[faint drumbeat]
13;1;7;Before a Fall;;[bird calls]
14;1;7;Before a Fall;;[stirring music plays]
15;1;7;Before a Fall;;[rhythmic marching]
16;1;7;Before a Fall;;[men calling out]
17;1;7;Before a Fall;;[men yelling]
18;1;7;Before a Fall;;[door opens]
19;1;7;Before a Fall;;[door clanks shut]
20;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Out of nowhere, you send word to meet you.
21;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;All this time, I thought you were dead.
22;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I told you last time I was in Cintra that I wasn't coming back.
23;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Yet here you are.
24;1;7;Before a Fall;;[Geralt grunts softly]
25;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[Mousesack] Why?
26;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;You've come for your Child of Surprise...
27;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;haven't you?
28;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;The opposite.
29;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I want you to tell me that he's safe and healthy so I can keep on riding.
30;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;He...
31;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;is a girl.
32;1;7;Before a Fall;;[chuckles]
33;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Yes.
34;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Princess Cirilla has been raised by Calanthe since her parents died.
35;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;What?
36;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[Mousesack] Pavetta and Duny's ship was lost at sea.
37;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Have you been hiding your head in the sand?
38;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Why now?
39;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Why do you think she's not safe?
40;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I saw an army making camp at the Amell Pass.
41;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;A sea of black and gold.
42;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[Mousesack] Nilfgaard is set on sweeping the Continent.
43;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;But since that night at Pavetta's banquet,
44;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;the Queen's done everything she can to keep her family safe from threats.
45;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Shut the walls.
46;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Fortified the gates.
47;1;7;Before a Fall;;[running footsteps]
48;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Sent assassins!
49;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;What?
50;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Were you followed?
51;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;No!
52;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Hmm.
53;1;7;Before a Fall;;[clattering]
54;1;7;Before a Fall;;[rattling]
55;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Hmm?
56;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Hmm.
57;1;7;Before a Fall;;[yells]
58;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;You want me, you kill him first!
59;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Geralt!
60;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Do something!
61;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;This is on your Queen.
62;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;We will both die.
63;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Blame destiny.
64;1;7;Before a Fall;;[all yelling]
65;1;7;Before a Fall;;[theme music playing]
66;1;7;Before a Fall;Danek;The Nilfgaardians don't strike me as foolish.
67;1;7;Before a Fall;Danek;Coming at us now would be right stupid.
68;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;The army whose stink I can smell  on a strong breeze is one I worry about.
69;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;So we prepare, same as always.
70;1;7;Before a Fall;Lazlo;When does the King return from Skellige, Your Majesty?
71;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;This morning. Be good to see that craggy face.
72;1;7;Before a Fall;Danek;Be better to see the 50 ships the Skelligens promised.
73;1;7;Before a Fall;Danek;Your Majesty.
74;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;No offense taken, Danek.
75;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;You know I agree.
76;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;We've taken on every pissant pretender for a dozen years.
77;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;If Nilfgaard need to learn the lesson the rest of them have,
78;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;we'll be ready for them.
79;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I want reports from the Amell Pass every hour...
80;1;7;Before a Fall;;[guards drawing swords]
81;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I warned you about coming back.
82;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I've been away 12 years and I'd planned on staying that way...
83;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;till you sent eight men to kill me.
84;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Well, I'm asking you now.
85;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Do not do this.
86;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;If you treated me more like a friend than a threat...
87;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Do you know the difference anymore?
88;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I'm here
89;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;to protect the girl.
90;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Who I've raised as my own.
91;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Why would I give my only heir
92;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;to someone who never cared enough to come back for her?
93;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Move along, Witcher. I'll pay whatever you want.
94;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I can't be bought.
95;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;You should remember.
96;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Money can't undo the Law of Surprise.
97;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Kings who've tried to outbid destiny
98;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;end up on pikes.
99;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;And if I win the war but lose Ciri,
100;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;what victory is that?
101;1;7;Before a Fall;;[swords clanking]
102;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Maybe that army won't come, and if they do, maybe you'll be ready.
103;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;But if you have any doubt in your mind that she's safe here,
104;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;give her to me.
105;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Call it destiny, security, what larger forces at work,
106;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I don't care.
107;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I will take her, protect her,
108;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;and bring her back unharmed, I promise you that.
109;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Ciri is all I have left of my daughter.
110;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;If Ciri survives, then Pavetta lives on too.
111;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Law of Surprise has been called.
112;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I'll tell Cirilla myself.
113;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;Oh, sweet Cintra, you were so promising,
114;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;from your spoiled princess to your stupid old king!
115;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;But when I arrived, the royals were dead!
116;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;Tossed out a window or shot in the head!
117;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;[devil puppet] So, what to do now? Where's the devil to go?
118;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;Anywhere but here. Back in your hole!
119;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;[devil puppet] No, don't cast me out on a whim!
120;1;7;Before a Fall;puppet;Who needs you when I've got him?
121;1;7;Before a Fall;;[devil puppet shouting]
122;1;7;Before a Fall;;[donkey braying]
123;1;7;Before a Fall;;[man] Hey!
124;1;7;Before a Fall;man;Where'd you get a piece like this?
125;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;It was my mother's.
126;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;[woman] Hey, girl!
127;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;What's so special about Skellige?
128;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;Those roads aren't safe,
129;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;and the Skelligens are a grumpy lot.
130;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;How about this?
131;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;Come with me.
132;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;I've got one more thing to buy.
133;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;and then we'll make room on Clip and Clop
134;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;and be home by dark.
135;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;We don't have much, but we've got a sight more than you do.
136;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;Roof,
137;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;food, space on the floor to sleep.
138;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;A lot's happening on this Continent, but we're safer when we stick together.
139;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;Okay?
140;1;7;Before a Fall;woman;Grand.
141;1;7;Before a Fall;;[neighs]
142;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;[Calanthe] It's what has been promised.
143;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;We must sacrifice... to fulfill destiny.
144;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs]
145;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Shh...
146;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sobs]
147;1;7;Before a Fall;;[door slams shut]
148;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;He may take you,
149;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;but you will always be mine.
150;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sniffles]
151;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I need you to be brave now, because who are you?
152;1;7;Before a Fall;fake ciri;The Lion Cub of Cintra.
153;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Pleased to meet you, Princess.
154;1;7;Before a Fall;fake ciri;Can I say goodbye to my friends now?
155;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Of course.
156;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I'll summon you when she's ready.
157;1;7;Before a Fall;;[whooshing]
158;1;7;Before a Fall;;[crashing]
159;1;7;Before a Fall;;[metallic rattling]
160;1;7;Before a Fall;;[rattling stops]
161;1;7;Before a Fall;;[indistinct whispering]
162;1;7;Before a Fall;;[flies buzzing]
163;1;7;Before a Fall;;[horse neighing]
164;1;7;Before a Fall;;[indistinct chatter]
165;1;7;Before a Fall;boy;[boy] Go on, Korin, do it! Oh! Gimme.
166;1;7;Before a Fall;fake ciri;Korin, Anton, I have to go.
167;1;7;Before a Fall;bot;What? No!
168;1;7;Before a Fall;fake ciri;I know!
169;1;7;Before a Fall;Anton;[Anton] Take care.
170;1;7;Before a Fall;fake ciri;Your Highness.
171;1;7;Before a Fall;;[boys laughing]
172;1;7;Before a Fall;Anton;[Anton] Throw those knuckles.
173;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;First, you try to kill me, then you lie to me.
174;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I'm just trying to keep Cirilla safe.
175;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Ciri is safe, with me, until the day she takes over my throne.
176;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Listen to me.
177;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I did listen once.
178;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Let a hedgehog into my court.
179;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;It got me Pavetta dead.
180;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I won't lose Ciri too.
181;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;So you and destiny can both fuck right off.
182;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Because if Nilfgaard comes, will destiny carry a banner into battle?
183;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;No.
184;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;We have an army, a navy...
185;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;and me.
186;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;A dynasty can't survive on arrogance alone.
187;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Says a witcher.
188;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;She needs family.
189;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;You know nothing about that.
190;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Your own mother cared so little, she discarded you.
191;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;You lecture me on a mother's love yet offer up someone else's daughter.
192;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Queen to all of Cintra, grandmother to one.
193;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I won't orphan that girl.
194;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;You're sentencing her to death.
195;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;What did I miss?
196;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Nothing.
197;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;Get him out of my sight.
198;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;I remember when you honored the Law of Surprise.
199;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;What changed?
200;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;I had a granddaughter.
201;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;So protect her.
202;1;7;Before a Fall;;Your Majesty.
203;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;What if Calanthe's wrong?
204;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;What if they come and Ciri is trapped?
205;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;I fight side by side with my Queen.
206;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;You put too much faith in that woman.
207;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;Well, you weren't there.
208;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;After Pavetta died, Calanthe would wake up howling in the night.
209;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;The Lioness, nearly broken.
210;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;Someone who's able to pull themselves out of that,
211;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;they'll have my confidence till my final day.
212;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;I need your promise you won't come back.
213;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;If I hear Ciri's in danger,
214;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;you know I can't do that.
215;1;7;Before a Fall;Eist;I know.
216;1;7;Before a Fall;;[men yelling]
217;1;7;Before a Fall;;[tools scraping and hacking]
218;1;7;Before a Fall;man;[man] Just move it!
219;1;7;Before a Fall;man;Faster!
220;1;7;Before a Fall;man 2;[man 2] That's right! No water till you've finished!
221;1;7;Before a Fall;;[horse neighs]
222;1;7;Before a Fall;man 3;[man 3] Move it!
223;1;7;Before a Fall;man 4;[man 4] That's right!
224;1;7;Before a Fall;man 5;[man 5] All right, ditch diggers!
225;1;7;Before a Fall;man 6;[man 6] Move it!
226;1;7;Before a Fall;man 5;[man 5] Report any findings immediately!
227;1;7;Before a Fall;man 3;All visitors must declare themselves to the officers!
228;1;7;Before a Fall;man 4;Is it cleared yet?
229;1;7;Before a Fall;sentry;[sentry] Safe conduct?
230;1;7;Before a Fall;sentry;You're coming from Caingorn?
231;1;7;Before a Fall;sentry;How long will you be in Nazair?
232;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;That is yet to be determined.
233;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Hello, Yennefer.
234;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;[chuckling] The... the runes described a...
235;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;"a magnalith"" in Nazair,"
237;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Until Nilfgaard tore through all the lands.
238;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;They allow my research.
239;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;That's all I care about.
240;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Hmm. A man of principle.
241;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You don't understand.  Every glyph has a clue
242;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;to something across the Continent...
243;1;7;Before a Fall;;[groans]
244;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;...from a time before the Conjunction.
245;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Most are history, but some might be more.
246;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;The prophecy, the future, I want to explore all of it.
247;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;[chuckles] Wow.
248;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;That's a face. You hate it that much?
249;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Only because I have taste buds.
250;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Well, these people were starving before Nilfgaard.
251;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;See, most kings only care about their cocks and their coffers.
252;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;They look out for their people. Everybody gets something.
253;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;The same thing,
254;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;which tastes as if someone pissed in my cup.
255;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Sounds to me like you bought in.
256;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;No. No, it's, uh...
257;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;It's just that...
258;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;sometimes, boring is better.
259;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;No, it's not.
260;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Come on.
261;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] How long do you see yourself here?
262;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;There's a lot of hill left to dig. Why?
263;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Because I may be missing you.
264;1;7;Before a Fall;;[both chuckle]
265;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;See, the Yennefer I remember didn't miss anyone.
266;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Yeah, well...
267;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;What if...
268;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;it's not too late for what we talked about in the cave?
269;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;We could go somewhere with,
270;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;I don't know, two types of ale.
271;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You could...
272;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;play with your rocks,
273;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;and I'll work as a mage.
274;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You hate monoliths.
275;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Yes, but--
276;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;But what?
277;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;I mean, look at you. You could have anyone.
278;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;I have.
279;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;And it was fun to be wanted.
280;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;The object of desire.
281;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;After where I came from, I lapped it up.
282;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;But they all loved the power that came with my position at court.
283;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Not my power.
284;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;And no one's ever seen that but me?
285;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs deeply]
286;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You know,
287;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;I spent...
288;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;I spent years...
289;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;waiting for this moment where you realized we're meant for each other.
290;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You know, coming up with excuses to study at Aedirn.
291;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Henges, dead languages, anything to get closer to you again, and....
292;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;every request I made was denied.
293;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You shut them all down.
294;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs]
295;1;7;Before a Fall;;[scoffs softly]
296;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Stregobor, of all people, snapped me out of it.
297;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Forget about the girl.
299;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Remembered why I loved it. The beauty, the purity. No...
300;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;distractions when I'm in it.
301;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;You went after the thing you loved.
302;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;Sorry you chose power.
303;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs]
304;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sniffles]
305;1;7;Before a Fall;Istredd;At least you kept your eyes.
306;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs shakily]
307;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;His loss.
308;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Piss off.
309;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Well, I would, but we don't have much time.
310;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Who the fuck are you?
311;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[whispering] I'm Vilgefortz of Roggeveen.
312;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Why are you whispering?
313;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Nilfgaard is conscripting mages like us into their service.
314;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Now, since...
315;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Now, since I don't have a letter of safe conduct,
316;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;and yours is probably fake, we should go,
317;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;before those lads start asking questions.
318;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Go where?
319;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[Vilgefortz] Aretuza.
320;1;7;Before a Fall;;[laughs]
321;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[Vilgefortz] Well, the feeling's mutual.
322;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;The Chapter thinks you're rash,
323;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;unpredictable and dangerous.
324;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;But right now,
325;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;that's exactly what Tissaia and I need.
326;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Tissaia asked for me?
327;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;She said you're the best student she ever taught.
328;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[Vilgefortz] Let's talk.
329;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;About what?
330;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Nilfgaard.
331;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Their army's camped near Cintra, and we think they're going to attack.
332;1;7;Before a Fall;Sabrina;And they won't stop there.
333;1;7;Before a Fall;Sabrina;We need allies from the Northern Kingdoms.
334;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;I'll leave this to the people who actually give a shit. Where's Tissaia?
335;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[Vilgefortz] Tissaia can wait.
336;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Fine, I'll just follow the sound of crying girls.
337;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;[Vilgefortz] She has no idea you're here.
338;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You said she asked for me.
339;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;No.
340;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;I told you that she said you were her best student.
341;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;I'm the one that wants you here.
342;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;It took five minutes for the lies to start.
343;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Why did I expect anything else from a place held together by bullshit?
344;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia, echoing] Do you know how many people wouldn't blink if you died?
345;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[young Yennefer] Let me out!
346;1;7;Before a Fall;;[thumping on door]
347;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Let me out!
348;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] Sometimes, the best thing a flower can do for us is die.
349;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] You should've let me die.
350;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;At least I had control over that.
351;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] Mm, that's adorable, piglet.
352;1;7;Before a Fall;;[girls giggling]
353;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] You weren't taking control,
354;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;you were losing it.
355;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[echoing] You were losing it.
356;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;What the hell's going on in here?
357;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[girl] We were studying. Botany.
358;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;If I gave Rectress de Vries  your pitiful excuse about that pitiful plant,
359;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;I'd be gone by nightfall.
360;1;7;Before a Fall;;[scoffs softly]
361;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;But fuck that old bag!
362;1;7;Before a Fall;;[girls laugh hesitantly]
363;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;This was my room.
364;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Before anyone you know was born.
365;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;So, you've been to court?
366;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Aedirn.
367;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;It's very elegant.
368;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Very boring.
369;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Why are you back, then?
370;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Why am I back?
371;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;I bet you hate botany as much as I did.
372;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Who wants to know what those herbs are really good for?
373;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Rhwydwaith carthion.
374;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;They've taught you about its healing powers
375;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;and fortifying blah, blah, blah.
376;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;But they leave out  that if you mix these two together,
377;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;you'll see colors like never...
378;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;before.
379;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Miss tells us never to mix herbs.
380;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;They tell you that so you have to go to them for all the answers.
381;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;A word of advice.
382;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Think for yourselves.
383;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;It'll save you a lifetime of heartbreak.
384;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[girl] The ceiling's melting.
385;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] No.
386;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;The herbs are working.
387;1;7;Before a Fall;;[giggling]
388;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[girl, echoing] Well, I don't feel...
389;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;What was I saying?
390;1;7;Before a Fall;;[laughing]
391;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Gods, you're pretty.
392;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Oh, don't worry, Fola.
393;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;You'll look like that too.
394;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Nobody starts off that way.
395;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You want to know a secret?
396;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Nobody starts off that way.
397;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;It's overrated.
398;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Look, I'm levitating!
399;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[echoing] Levitating, I'm levitating.
400;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Glacella, whatever you lack in talent, you make up for in confidence.
401;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[Fola] She doesn't need confidence. Her father owns half of Creyden.
402;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;So he could swap a hundred horses for her spot here.
403;1;7;Before a Fall;;[giggling]
404;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Your parents paid Aretuza?
405;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;The Chapter decided it needed students from the best families.
406;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;But you all must have had a conduit moment?
407;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;We shouldn't be mixing herbs. We shouldn't even be here.
408;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;You know, if they catch us, they really will expel us.
409;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;There are far worse things than expulsion.
410;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;Like what?
411;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;What is this place?
412;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Aretuza's windmill.
413;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Enough bridled chaos to keep the curtains hung...
414;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;and the torches lit, but that's not what we're here for.
415;1;7;Before a Fall;Glacella;[Glacella] I think we should go.
416;1;7;Before a Fall;Fola;[Fola] Wait. I've got so many questions.
417;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] You want to know more.
418;1;7;Before a Fall;Fola;[Fola] Yes.
419;1;7;Before a Fall;Fola;Everything.
420;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;The ability to create life,
421;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;real life,
422;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;they take that from you.
423;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;And then send you out,
424;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;so the only family, the only loyalty you have,
425;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;is to them.
426;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;And you'll trade it all for what?
427;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Looks that never change.
428;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;A court full of idiots.
429;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;But you don't have to do it.
430;1;7;Before a Fall;Fola;But what if I want to?
431;1;7;Before a Fall;Glacella;We're leaving. Come on.
432;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Lesson's not over yet!
433;1;7;Before a Fall;Glacella;Just because you fucked up, doesn't mean we will.
434;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You?
435;1;7;Before a Fall;Glacella;Come on.
436;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;With all the magical talent of shoe leather?
437;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You'll have a home here forever, Glacella.
438;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Right here.
439;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;With my sisters who never ascended.
440;1;7;Before a Fall;;[ringing sound]
441;1;7;Before a Fall;Fola;What's happening?
442;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Anica, is that you?
443;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[young Yennefer] You turned my friend into a slug.
444;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] An eel.
445;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Come, push your friend into the pool.
446;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] I don't care what you do, but remember this.
447;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Even if you do everything right,
448;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;follow their rules,
449;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;that's still no guarantee you'll get what you want.
450;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] Enough!
451;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Back to your rooms, girls.
452;1;7;Before a Fall;;[Yennefer sighs]
453;1;7;Before a Fall;;[scoffs softly]
454;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;You ruined one life.
455;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Stop there.
456;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] I never even wanted to come back here!
457;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[sighs] Then you failed at that, too.
458;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Look at this place.
459;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;It's a joke.
460;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Letting in girls who can't even do magic!
461;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Sometimes, you have to compromise in order to survive.
462;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You say I never took responsibility for the way my life turned out.
463;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;What about you?
464;1;7;Before a Fall;girl;[girl] But what's happening? I don't understand...
465;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] What's going on?
466;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] It's happening.
467;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Triss!
468;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;Yennefer.
469;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;I tried finding you for years.
470;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Why are you all here?
471;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;An emergency conclave of the Northern Mages.
472;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
473;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;What?
474;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;They're attacking Cintra.
475;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;[Artorius] Going to war against Nilfgaard is madness.
476;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;And for Cintra?
477;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;They've rejected our mages for decades, so let's grant them their wish.
478;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;It's not just about Cintra.
479;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Nilfgaard won't be satisfied until they have the whole Continent.
480;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;And how do you know this?
481;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Because that's the same lie I would tell.
482;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;I'm the only one here that's led soldiers into battle.
483;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Oh, yes, and don't we know it?
484;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;You wear your silly costume
485;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;every chance you get.
486;1;7;Before a Fall;;[mages laugh]
487;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;All those years swinging his sword around were years he wasn't serving as a mage.
488;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Or killing babies born at an eclipse.
489;1;7;Before a Fall;;[murmuring]
490;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;We can stop Nilfgaard, if we act now.
491;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;The south... well, is the south.
492;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;It is up to the north to unite.
493;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;It is time to convince our kings to send their armies.
494;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;They could cross the Yaruga,
495;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;make it to Sodden by week's end.
496;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;They could save Cintra.
497;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;If Cintra falls, who cares?
498;1;7;Before a Fall;;[muttering]
499;1;7;Before a Fall;Sabrina;[woman] I care!
500;1;7;Before a Fall;Sabrina;Because our kingdoms will be next.
501;1;7;Before a Fall;;[door opens]
502;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;Our fight is with Cintra, and only Cintra.
503;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;In Nilfgaard, we know what it's like to have corrupt leaders.
504;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;But under our new leader, Emperor Emhyr, we've changed.
505;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We've strengthened trade.
506;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We've funded research.
507;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We have torn down walls,
508;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;whilst Queen Calanthe has done nothing but put them up.
509;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;I am not here to defend Cintra.
510;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;But I will defend our way of life.
511;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;The Brotherhood, the Academies,
512;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;the order that we have built up over centuries.
513;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;You've rejected it all, Fringilla.
514;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;[Fringilla] Not true. We've modified it.
515;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;Most of us came from Aretuza and Ban Ard.
516;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We've simply charted a different path,
517;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;guided by the White Flame.
518;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;That makes us cousins, not enemies.
519;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;You force mages into servitude!
520;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;[Fringilla] When in training, yes.  Like soldiers.
521;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We believe in shared sacrifice.
522;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;[Triss] You also believe in forbidden magic.
523;1;7;Before a Fall;Triss;Demonology, necromancy, fire magic!
524;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;[Fringilla] Forbidden magic is one of the ghost stories taught to us here.
525;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;There is no such thing as dark or light magic.
526;1;7;Before a Fall;;[screaming]
527;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;[Fringilla] Nothing in this world is as simple as that.
528;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;You think that we're destroying the Continent.
529;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;We know that if we take Cintra, we have a chance of saving it.
530;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;If you won't take sides, then at least stay out of our way.
531;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;[Stregobor] Ah, enough of this tiring debate.
532;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Cintra's a lost cause.
533;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Let them reap what they sow.
534;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;I say we vote.
535;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Yes, vote. Vote!
536;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;Vote?
537;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;First, you install your niece at Nilfgaard,
538;1;7;Before a Fall;Vilgefortz ;and now you want to ram through a vote.
539;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;[Fringilla] To be fair, Yennefer of Vengerberg
540;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;is the one I have to thank for my posting.
541;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;If she had taken it, I wouldn't be where I am today.
542;1;7;Before a Fall;Fringilla;Neither would Nilfgaard.
543;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;If only Yennefer had gone to Nilfgaard.
544;1;7;Before a Fall;Artorius;With her at the helm, they'd still be a shitty backwater.
545;1;7;Before a Fall;;[laughing]
546;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;You're right.
547;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Instead, I went to a prized kingdom and did fuck all for decades.
548;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Just as you taught us.
549;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Helped murderers and rapists keep their crown.
550;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Maybe it is time for something different.
551;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Pipe down. You-- you don't get a vote.
552;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;If I did, I'd vote to burn it all down.
553;1;7;Before a Fall;;[clamoring]
554;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;There! There you have--
555;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;There you have it!
556;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[Tissaia] It's true.
557;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Cintra has chosen to turn its back on us.
558;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;They are proud, and smart, and difficult, yes.
559;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;But I'd wager above all else...
560;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;they are scared.
561;1;7;Before a Fall;;[woman] It's true.
562;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;We have called them a lost cause for years.
563;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;But we stopped trying too.
564;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;And it is time now...
565;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;that we risk not only our lives, but our pride,
566;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;and try again.
567;1;7;Before a Fall;;[indistinct murmuring]
568;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;With your permission,
569;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;all those in favor
570;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;of letting Cintra continue their proud tradition
571;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;of fending for themselves?
572;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;Well...
573;1;7;Before a Fall;Stregobor;there you have it.
574;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs]
575;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;I know you hate this place, but there are girls who need it.
576;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Those who have only ever known chaos until we teach them control.
577;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;You were right, in Rinde.
578;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Aretuza is all I have.
579;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;If Nilfgaard wins...
580;1;7;Before a Fall;;[indistinct chatter]
581;1;7;Before a Fall;;[door opens]
582;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;[softly] That's why Vilgefortz and I and some others are going to fight.
583;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;You should join us.
584;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Did you hear a word I just said?
585;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Why would I protect this?
586;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;If you will not do it for the Brotherhood, then do it for me.
587;1;7;Before a Fall;Tissaia;Please.
588;1;7;Before a Fall;Yennefer;Have you ever used that word before?
589;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[Mousesack] Your Majesty,
590;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;the Nilfgaardians will breach the castle gates.
591;1;7;Before a Fall;;[cheering]
592;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[Mousesack] Have breached.
593;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;Now what?
594;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;What do we do?
595;1;7;Before a Fall;;[grunts]
596;1;7;Before a Fall;;[keys clattering]
597;1;7;Before a Fall;Geralt;Hmm.
598;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;The Witcher...
599;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I couldn't let him go.
600;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;I know what I've done.
601;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;He's in the gate keep.
602;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;If I can bring him here...
603;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;to Ciri...
604;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;destiny may yet side with us.
605;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Danek.
606;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;It's time.
607;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;Wait, where are you going?
608;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Geralt!
609;1;7;Before a Fall;;[sighs]
610;1;7;Before a Fall;;[man yells]
611;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Your Majesty...
612;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;[whispers] He's gone.
613;1;7;Before a Fall;Mousesack;Looks like he's escaped.
614;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;If he is out there,
615;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;then there is still hope for her.
616;1;7;Before a Fall;ciri;What is it?
617;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Lazlo, bring her cloak.
618;1;7;Before a Fall;;[gasps]
619;1;7;Before a Fall;ciri;What? No!
620;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;Continue to be brave. Promise me.
621;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;You are the Lion Cub of Cintra.
622;1;7;Before a Fall;Calanthe;You are destined for great things.
623;1;7;Before a Fall;Ciri;I can't do this without you.
624;1;7;Before a Fall;Lazlo;We must go, Your Highness.
625;1;7;Before a Fall;ciri;[screams] No!
