1;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cawing]
2;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[caws]
3;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Love surprises.
4;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Love visitors.
5;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;A surprise visitor all the more.
6;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;I've had eyes on you for a while.
7;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
8;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;We're very flattered.
9;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;But who is this secret peeper
10;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;peeping all our secrets?
11;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;I know who you are.
12;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;What you are.
13;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;You're different to other dopplers.
14;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;You're not good-natured or helpful, are you?
15;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;And yet you are here for our help.
16;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Do you not have errand boys where you come from?
17;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;They lacked your valuable set of skills.
18;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;Don't worry.
19;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[raven cawing]
20;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;It's not silver.
21;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;We fancy our freedom.
22;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;It is not money we thirst for, per se.
23;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;There is plenty that you do thirst for.
24;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;Assassination on behalf of the Kingdom of Nilfgaard.
25;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;Or perhaps another eye or ear to round out your artful composition.
26;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;We'd planned on wearing this one for a while.
27;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;But we are flexible.
28;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[neighing]
29;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[horse nickers]
30;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[men shouting]
31;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
32;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groaning]
33;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
34;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coughing]
35;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
36;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;A cell of dimeritium made just for you.
37;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;How does it feel to be neutered of your powers?
38;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;I know how you were schooled,
39;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;how you were shaped.
40;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;This isn't who you are.
41;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;The White Flame made me who I am...
42;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;gave me a higher purpose.
43;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;You could've had that too,
44;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Fringilla;if only you realized that Cintra had to fall.
45;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;I have found his purpose.
46;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;This one?
47;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Do we have to?
48;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
49;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
50;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;Run.
51;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
52;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
53;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;[Black Knight] I said run!
54;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[whimpering]
55;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[horse neighs]
56;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[yells]
57;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[breathing heavily]
58;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Everything you've ever done,
59;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;ever debated,
60;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;ever dreamed,
61;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;is in our head now.
62;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Even this morning,
63;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;when you thought to take your life.
64;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;He didn't want to be abused.
65;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;[doppler] Incorrect.
66;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;He didn't want to be used.  [chuckles]
67;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;You can't change the world this way.
68;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;Only one of us will be alive to find out.
69;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Yeah.
70;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasping]
71;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
72;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;You don't know what you're doing.
73;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groaning]
74;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Mousesack;You don't know what she is.
75;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;She will end up where she belongs.
76;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cracking]
77;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Mousesack whimpers]
78;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
79;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Would've made a terrible noose.
80;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Cahir;You're to bring me the girl alive.
81;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;So many rules.
82;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Fine.
83;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;But it'll cost you.
84;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;Children are our favorite.
85;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;You're a wee bit shy.
86;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I've never been shy a day in my life.
87;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Count it again.
88;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Times are shifting, my dear.
89;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;My rates have gone up since last we spoke.
90;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;I've found more demand for my services.
91;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Then your customers will be awfully disappointed
92;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;when they find a charred spot where you once stood.
93;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;None more so than yourself.
94;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;You've come so far already.
95;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Just a few more...
96;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;treatments should do the trick.
97;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Isn't it lovely,
98;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;the life we've chosen?
99;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Not being bound by the rules of the Brotherhood.
100;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Living off the grid with no resources.
101;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Mm. It's a dream come true.
102;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[loud thud]
103;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Lucky for you, you found your way to an intolerant kingdom.
104;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;For quick coin, head to the nearest town in any direction.
105;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Your skills will be rewarded.
106;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;If it's as you say, then why aren't you out there taking advantage?
107;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;As you're so inclined.
108;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Hemet chuckles]
109;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Because my customers...
110;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;come to me.
111;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Hm.
112;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;[Hemet]  I see a lot of myself in you.
113;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Follow my footsteps.
114;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;You could gain some repute.
115;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;Find a whole new career to fund what you...
116;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;so desperately want.
117;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
118;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;With mages like us,
119;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Hemet;word of mouth is paramount.
120;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;"There is no us."" There's only me."""
121;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And I know a thing or two about stirring word of mouth.
122;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct chatter]
123;1;5;Bottled Appetites;woman;[woman] I'd given up altogether.
124;1;5;Bottled Appetites;woman;Love, that's nice, but not on the cards for me.
125;1;5;Bottled Appetites;woman;Not in my lifetime.
126;1;5;Bottled Appetites;woman;It took me nearly a whole one to find him.
127;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
128;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[woman moans softly]
129;1;5;Bottled Appetites;man;As you can see, passion is not the trouble.
130;1;5;Bottled Appetites;man;Our issue...
131;1;5;Bottled Appetites;man;my... issue is of a mechanical nature.
132;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Hm.
133;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I have just the thing.
134;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Now, be prepared.
135;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The spell should take effect quickly,
136;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;and will endure until your lady utters a handpicked magic word.
137;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Anything come to mind?
138;1;5;Bottled Appetites;woman;Kumquat?
139;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You arrived at that rather quickly.
140;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Kumquat it is.
141;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct chanting]
142;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
143;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coughs]
144;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
145;1;5;Bottled Appetites;man;We'd better go now, schnucki.
146;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[door opens]
147;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[door closes]
148;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;What is this...
149;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;wretched business here?
150;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Did you not understand the sign?
151;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;Are you familiar with who I am?
152;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coins clink]
153;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Well, won't you end this rather melodramatic suspense and tell me?
154;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;He is Beau Berrant.
155;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;Perhaps you are not aware  of the rules here?
156;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;If you are casting spells,
157;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;I need to collect what's due to the kingdom.
158;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I'm afraid those terms seem rather shite to me.
159;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
160;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I did suspect you possessed such a predilection.
161;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Though I am less...
162;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;burly than your usual type.
163;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;[Dryad General, in Elder] We can't trust her.
164;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;She hid her identity, her past,
165;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;her ties to Cintra...
166;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Shan-Kayan is the only reason we know who she is.
167;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Ciri was scared.
168;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Perhaps she can't yet trust us.
169;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;We still don't know her intent.
170;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;She's a girl...
171;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Who possesses the power of a weapon.
172;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;In Brokilon, she can be molded.
173;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;She can become one of us.
174;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;She's not one of us.
175;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Nilfgaardian spies.
176;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Found them searching our border.
177;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Their whole army will arrive. It's only a matter of time.
178;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;What if this girl...
179;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;is our only way...
180;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;to survive?
181;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[rustling]
182;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Ciri...
183;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;[in English] ...will be allowed to stay.
184;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[exhales deeply]
185;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;I don't think they like me.
186;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;When Queen Calanthe closed the borders of Cintra,
187;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;it was to protect her people.
188;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;The General wants to protect us.
189;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;We all make decisions.
190;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;The sword of destiny has two edges.
191;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;What does that mean?
192;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;You must make the choice.
193;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;You can stay. Or you can continue on your search.
194;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;What do you want to do?
195;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[Jaskier] <song> 'Cause you all know That this bard <song>
196;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;<song> Loved ladies from Nilfgaard <song>
197;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;<song> 'Cause Nilfgaard can kiss my... <song>
198;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Geralt!
199;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Hello.
200;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What's it been, months? Years? What is time, anyway?
201;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I heard you were in town.
202;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Are you following me, you scamp?
203;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I mean, I'm flattered and everything,
204;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;but you should really think about getting a hobby one of these days.
205;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Ugh!
206;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Do you want some?
207;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;"How are you doing?"" I hear you ask."
209;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, the Countess de Stael,
210;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;my muse and beauty of this world,
211;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;has left me.
212;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Again. Rather coldly and unexpectedly, I might add.
213;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I fear I shall die a brokenhearted man.
214;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Or a hungry one, at the very least,
215;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;unless somebody fancies sharing a fish with an old friend?
216;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;"Oh, are we not using friend""?"""
217;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Yeah, sure.  Let's just give it another decade.
218;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Geralt, you're fantastic at a great many things,
219;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;but clearly, fishing is not one of them.
220;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Have you caught anything today?
221;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What are you fishing for, exactly?
222;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Is it cod?
223;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Carp?
224;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Pike?
225;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Bream?
226;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I'm just-- I'm just listing fish that I know.
227;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Zander? Is that a fish?
228;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'm not fishing.
229;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I can't sleep.
230;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Right. Good.
231;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, that-- that makes sense.
232;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Insomuch that it sort of...
233;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;doesn't.
234;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What's going on, Geralt? Talk to me.
235;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
236;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;A djinn.
237;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[Jaskier] A what?
238;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] I'm looking for a djinn.
239;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;For a dj-- For a djinn?  A dj-- Like a genie?
240;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[laughs] The floaty fellas with the... the bad tempers
241;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;and the banned magics, that kind of genie?
242;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Yes. It'll grant me wishes.
243;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[laughs]
244;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;It's in this lake somewhere.
245;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;And I can't fucking sleep!
246;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
247;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I don't mean to play priest's ear or anything,
248;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;but has it occurred to you that maybe we're merely rubbing salve on a tumor?
249;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Not exactly addressing the root cause of the problem?
250;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Hm?
251;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I mean, maybe, just-- just maybe,
252;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;this whole sleeplessness-ness
253;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;has got something to do with what  the druid Mousesack said to you in Cintra?
254;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;You know, the Law of Surprise?
255;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Destiny?
256;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Being unable to escape the child that belongs to you, et cetera, et cetera?
257;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;No! It's not that.
258;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Yeah, you're probably right.
259;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;But what if you're not?
260;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;You know, the Countess de Stael once said to me
261;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;that destiny is just the embodiment of the soul's desire to grow.
262;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Did you sing to her before she left?
263;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I did, actually, and she...
264;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Why, what are you implying?
265;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh... [laughs]
266;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;We are so having this conversation. Come on, Geralt. Tell me. Be honest.
267;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;How's my singing?
268;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[water splashes]
269;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;It's like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling.
270;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[stutters in shock]
271;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;You need a nap!
272;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I mean, are you trying to hurt my feelings, Geralt? It's...
273;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;It's down-- downright indecorous of you, if I'm completely honest, and--
274;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[stammers] Wow. Wow.  What is-- what is that?
275;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;It's a wizard's seal.
276;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;The djinn.
277;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[Jaskier] Do you mind if I--
278;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Jaskier.
279;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Take it back about my fillingless pie.
280;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Take it back, you get your djinny-djinn-djinn.
281;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Let go.
282;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;No! No, let go, you horse's arse!
283;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Hm.
284;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;That's a bit of an anticlimax.
285;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[breeze stirring]
286;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Or is it?
287;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wind rising]
288;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Djinn, I have freed thee, and as of this day, I am thy lord.
289;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Firstly, may Valdo Marx, the troubadour of Cidaris,
290;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;be struck down with apoplexy and die.
291;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Secondly, the Countess de Stael must welcome me back with glee,
292;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;open arms and very little clothing.
293;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Thirdly--
294;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Jaskier!
295;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Wha--
296;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Stop!
297;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[panting]
298;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;There are only three wishes.
299;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh, come on, you always say you want nothing from life.
300;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;How was I to know you wanted three wishes all to yourself?
301;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I just want some damn peace!
302;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, here's your peace!
303;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[amphora smashes]
304;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[growls]
305;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wind whistling]
306;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt groans]
307;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[choking]
308;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coughs and gasps]
309;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Geralt...
310;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Geralt... it's the djinn!
311;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[yells]
312;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[screeching and growling]
313;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezes]
314;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coughs]
315;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wheezing]
316;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Jaskier.
317;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[coughing]
318;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Is there a doctor here?
319;1;5;Bottled Appetites;soldier;Yes, yes. Chireadan, the elf healer.
320;1;5;Bottled Appetites;soldier;Over there.
321;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezing]
322;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
323;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;A djinn in a bottle?  It's like a fairy tale.
324;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Without the happy ending. Can you help him?
325;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wheezing]
326;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasping for breath]
327;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Oh, dear.
328;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;What?
329;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I assure you I have received the best medical education
330;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;right here in Rinde, but...
331;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;these injuries are of a magical nature.
332;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I can help with the pain, but it's a bit like...
333;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Putting salve on a tumor?
334;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;No!
335;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;His throat was attacked.
336;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;If the spell's action isn't halted as soon as possible,
337;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;that damage might be irreversible.
338;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[groans] Wha--
339;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;[Chireadan] And the longer he goes untreated,
340;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;the more likely it is to spread.
341;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;He could die.
342;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
343;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Fuck! Geralt.
344;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Uh...
345;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Yeah, we won't let that happen.
346;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;The medicine should buy him a few hours, but he needs a magical remedy.
347;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;You'll have to take him to another town.
348;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;There isn't a mage here?
349;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Uh...
350;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;The mayor says they are dangerous.
351;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;What aren't you saying?
352;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezing]
353;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Tell me.
354;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Well...
355;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;there...
356;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;there is one mage.
357;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I...
358;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;was tasked with bringing this mage to justice.
359;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;But I was unable to penetrate certain defenses.
360;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;The mayor himself has made the catch and has imprisoned the mage in his house.
361;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;That wasn't so fucking hard, was it?
362;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans in pain]
363;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;[Chireadan] Be careful.
364;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;The mage is powerful and malicious.
365;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;And quite cunning.
366;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'll go find him.
367;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasping and coughing]
368;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;[Tissaia] You like pain.
369;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;We get it.
370;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I inflict pain.
371;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;My dear, you still think there's a difference.
372;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;It's been too long.
373;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;I haven't seen you for years.
374;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Not since you maneuvered your way onto Aedirn's court.
375;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Mm.
376;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;I heard that went well.
377;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;King Virfuril is fine, I'm sure.
378;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;He's dead now.
379;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;King Demavend reigns now.
380;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Down south, Fringilla's thrived in the post that should've been yours.
381;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;The rightful heir returned to Nilfgaard and she's helped him restore peace.
382;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Why are you here?
383;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;[Tissaia] You remained hidden for a while,
384;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;but now,
385;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;you're making noise.
386;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You're looking for something.
387;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You're wasting your time.
388;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;The so-called mages you're enlisting will not help you with your problem.
389;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;And if you're not careful, you will become just like them... irrelevant.
390;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You are pure chaos right now.
391;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You want a cure, and it's making you sloppy.
392;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;The Brotherhood left you to your own devices
393;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;once you abandoned Aedirn.
394;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;But this behavior,
395;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;flaunted in direct conflict with their agenda,
396;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;will not be tolerated.
397;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;They will come after you.
398;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] That's why you're here.
399;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;To warn me.
400;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;How can I ever repay you?
401;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Don't be petty.
402;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;This is on you.
403;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You knew the cost of enchantment.
404;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;But I didn't know what it would mean to me.
405;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;What does it mean to you?
406;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Why?
407;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Why do you want a baby?
408;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The Continent is vast.
409;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Just because you don't know of a cure doesn't mean there isn't one.
410;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;It's simply beyond your scope.
411;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;It is time to move on.
412;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Return to Aretuza.
413;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;No, thank you.
414;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Aretuza might be everything to you, but I'd rather forget it.
415;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Aretuza is everything to the Continent,
416;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;to world order.
417;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;I am here
418;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;to offer you a chance for redemption.
419;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Aedirn, all of this nonsense, will be forgiven and forgotten.
420;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;You can use your talents to shape a new generation.
421;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Am I hearing this right?
422;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The great Tissaia wants my help?
423;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What's the matter?
424;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Have you lost your touch?
425;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;Only you can be thrown a lifeline and think that you are saving me.
426;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You're afraid I'll be everything you could never be...
427;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;without you.
428;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Which is the rub.
429;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You only want me to do well so long as you had your hand in it.
430;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;How did we get this way?
431;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;I gave you all I could give.
432;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Tissaia;What more do you want?
433;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Everything.
434;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You may go, Rectoress.
435;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I have business to attend to.
436;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[horse neighing]
437;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;Whoa!
438;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[horse neighs]
439;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;[guard] A fee for entrance.
440;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezes]
441;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;A fee to see the mayor? This is urgent.
442;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;I don't make the rules,
443;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;but money opens all doors.
444;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[horse nickers]
445;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Hm.
446;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[thuds]
447;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;So it does.
448;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezing]
449;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
450;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Whoa!
451;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[clattering]
452;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Whoa.
453;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier wheezes]
454;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[jug shatters]
455;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;Welcome...
456;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;to my home.
457;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You're the Mayor of Rinde?
458;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Not exactly what I was expecting.
459;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;May-- May-- [whimpers]
460;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Sorry, he's in a bad way.
461;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Is there a mage that lives here?
462;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;Ah. The apple juice!
463;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;She wants some.
464;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;And she always gets...
465;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;what she wants.
466;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I don't understand. Does he want me to get him the apple juice?
467;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[breathlessly] I don't know.
468;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[whimpering]
469;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt grunts]
470;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Mayor Rinde snoring]
471;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Oh...
472;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Good.
473;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
474;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;The fuck?
475;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier gasps]
476;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt sighs] Hm.
477;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[slow, seductive music playing]
478;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
479;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;Stay.
480;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wheezes]
481;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I, uh...
482;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;brought you apple juice.
483;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And quite a bit more.
484;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You're immune.
485;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You must be the mage.
486;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Yennefer of Vengerberg.
487;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Hm.
488;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Chireadan didn't mention that, uh...
489;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What did he fail to mention?
490;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;We need your help.
491;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;"We""?"""
492;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wheezes]
493;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Just a friend, I hope?
494;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Your heartbeat, it's extraordinarily slow.
495;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You're...
496;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;a mutant.
497;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;A witcher.
498;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Geralt of Rivia.
499;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The famous White Wolf!
500;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I thought you'd have fangs or horns or something.
501;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I had them filed down.
502;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
503;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;First time I've seen a witcher up close.
504;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What little spells can you cast with your hands?
505;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Call it professional curiosity.
506;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Please,
507;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Jaskier here needs immediate attention.
508;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;And then, if you'd like,
509;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'll indulge your curiosity all night long.
510;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;It won't take all night.
511;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;But I'm sure we can find a way to fill the time.
512;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;He was attacked by a djinn.
513;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;A djinn?
514;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Whatever's wrong with him,
515;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;it's spreading.
516;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Fix it,
517;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;and I'll pay you.
518;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Whatever the price.
519;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct whispering]
520;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You'll have to do better than juice.
521;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Ragamuffin!
522;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[music stops]
523;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[all gasping and murmuring]
524;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[thuds]
525;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;He's in a deep healing sleep.
526;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;How long will he sleep for?
527;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Long enough for you to bathe.
528;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;How did you...
529;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Oh, right.
530;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Magic.
531;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;And I hardly think bathing in this house is going to leave me any cleaner.
532;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I insist.
533;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I can not only guess the age and breed of your horse,
534;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;but also its color...
535;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;by the smell.
536;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hm.
537;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer's footsteps receding]
538;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Fishing for a djinn seems an extreme measure
539;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;to remedy sleeplessness.
540;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;When extreme measures seem reasonable,
541;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;yes,
542;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'm desperate.
543;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
544;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And yet you didn't ask me to help with that.
545;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Looming death kind of jumped the queue.
546;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Now I'm wondering if I can afford you.
547;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Have I accidentally agreed to indentured servitude?
548;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer inhales]
549;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Go ahead,
550;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;ask about them.
551;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Everyone does.
552;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Everyone else is boring.
553;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Turn around.
554;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hm.
555;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;That's cheating.
556;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Nobody smart plays fair.
557;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Tell me,
558;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;are all witchers similarly blessed?
559;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Come now,
560;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;you promised.
561;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hm.
562;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I haven't conducted a survey,
563;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;but I'd hardly say we're blessed.
564;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Oh, don't be so grim.
565;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You were created by magic.
566;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Our magic.
567;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Thank you. Made for a magical childhood.
568;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Happy childhoods make for dull company.
569;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Judging by your wrists and your wits,
570;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;your childhood was very happy.
571;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;But Aretuza fixed you up nicely.
572;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;What was your ailment before?
573;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Clubbed foot?
574;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Split ends?
575;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Tell me, are there women who find this coarseness charming?
576;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Maybe some place where they find your coin very charming indeed.
577;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hm. You seem to find coin pretty charming yourself.
578;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Clearly capitalizing on the political situation here.
579;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I'm serving the stifled people of this town.
580;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Filling a need.
581;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Ever heard of it?
582;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hm.
583;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;It's fine to fly in the face of overzealous authority,
584;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;but to pretend it's anything other than making a profit...
585;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And to pretend you're after a djinn to cure insomnia?
586;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Hmm...
587;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[inhales] Fortunately for you,
588;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;once I've paid for your kind services,
589;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;it'll be none of your concern.
590;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Fortunately for you,
591;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I've determined your company and conversation payment enough.
592;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What's the matter?
593;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Water not suit?
594;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;This is a little tight.
595;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I believe I sized you up quite right.
596;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt sighs]
597;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Do you doubt my capabilities?
598;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] No.
599;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Just your intentions.
600;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I said some things to him.
601;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;He's a...
602;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;A friend?
603;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'd like it not to be the last thing he remembers.
604;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;He won't remember much if he's dead.
605;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chuckles]
606;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;It's a joke.
607;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;He will survive.
608;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And recover his vocal talents.
609;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Does that satisfy you?
610;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Not in the slightest.
611;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;But don't reproach yourself for it, Yennefer.
612;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'm not easily satisfied.
613;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[faint indistinct whispering]
614;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[whispering grows louder]
615;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;It's the sign from the seal.
616;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I'll be taking Jaskier now.
617;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;If you wake him before he's healed,
618;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;the spell won't take.
619;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;That's no way to treat a friend,
620;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Geralt.
621;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You want the djinn,
622;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;but the amphora's broken.
623;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;The djinn's already long gone.
624;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct whispering]
625;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Do go on.
626;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Tell me how stuff works.
627;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The djinn is tied to this plane and its master.
628;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;How many wishes did the bard express before he lost his voice?
629;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You need Jaskier to make his last wish so you can capture it.
630;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;So that's...
631;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;two... then.
632;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;The djinn will fight you.
633;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;If you try and bend it--
634;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[soft sighing sound]
635;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[clears throat]
636;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[inhales]
637;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Ah...
638;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;That scent...
639;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[soft sighing sound]
640;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Lilac and...
641;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Gooseberries.
642;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[exhales sharply]
643;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Tough to get in your head.
644;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
645;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You have a strong will,
646;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;but you can't contend with me.
647;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Sorry I couldn't be direct, I knew you'd fight it.
648;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;And I do love a good old-fashioned trap.
649;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;A good old-fashioned...
650;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;nap.
651;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;[Chireadan echoing] Wake up.
652;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Wake up!
653;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
654;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Chireadan.
655;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;At long last.
656;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[chain jingles]
657;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
658;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
659;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Where are we?
660;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;At the spa.  Where do you think we are?
661;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I hope your rampage was well worth it.
662;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
663;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;"Rampage""?"""
664;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;What did I do?
665;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Where to begin?
666;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;You...
667;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;attacked a pawnbroker in his shop,
668;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;kicking him in the delicate places.
669;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;[Geralt] Hm.
670;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;You also dragged the apothecary into the street,
671;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;pulled down his pants and thrashed his arse with a belt.
672;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Both are on the town council,
673;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;who are voting to usurp the mayor and kick Yennefer out.
674;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Any of this ring a bell?
675;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Like a faded dream.
676;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;She had you enact revenge on her behalf.
677;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I tried to stop you,
678;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;but the guards assumed I was there to abet.
679;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt sighs]
680;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;The sentence will be passed by the very council members you attacked.
681;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;It is sure to be death.
682;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;I suppose that's one way of getting some rest.
683;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Why on earth would you enlist the mage's help after my warning?
684;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;It's like you thought the scorpion  were prettier than a spider
685;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;because of its lovely tail.
686;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You weren't exactly forthcoming.
687;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I admit I could've better prepared you for Yennefer.
688;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You're under her spell, aren't you?
689;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I wish I was, but no.
690;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;It's a simple issue of body chemistry.
691;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;You're in love with her?
692;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;And I think perhaps you may understand me.
693;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[door opens]
694;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I thought it would take longer to build the scaffold.
695;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
696;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Geralt;Ah, fuck.
697;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;Here you are.
698;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;Remember me?
699;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;Did not know you were a witcher.
700;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;I've always wanted to play with one.
701;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[heart beating slowly]
702;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
703;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[wheezes]
704;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
705;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh! Where am I?
706;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Whew! Um...
707;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Right. Good.
708;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Good. Um...
709;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Not to be...
710;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;untoward or anything... [chuckles]
711;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;but... [stutters] ...did we...
712;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;you know...
713;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[stutters] ...do the, uh...
714;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Ooh, Go-- Oh, no! No!
715;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Definitely did not butter that biscuit.
716;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Look, I am so sorry,
717;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;but I've just remembered I left my... cat
718;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;on the...
719;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;stove.
720;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I-- I really must be going.
721;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Express your deepest desires and you can be on your way.
722;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, my deepest desires are currently satisfied, thank you so much.
723;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[yells]
724;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;How's your throat?
725;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;[Jaskier] Uh...
726;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Perhaps you should try some scales.
727;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Uh...
728;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;<song> Toss a coin to your witcher <song>
729;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;<song> O, Valley of... penis <song>
730;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh, God.
731;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;If you want to keep all you have...
732;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Jaskier whimpers]
733;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;...make a damn wish.
734;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasping]
735;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunting]
736;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[breathes deeply]
737;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;[guard] What's the difference between a witcher and a tub of dung?
738;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt grunts]
739;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
740;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Ah, I know that one. [chuckles]
741;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[yells]
742;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;What is repulsive,
743;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;deviant...
744;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt grunts]
745;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;...and cannot smell?
746;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;A witcher without a nose.
747;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt groans]
748;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;Last words, Witcher.
749;1;5;Bottled Appetites;guard;Make them good.
750;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;I want you to burst, you son of a whore.
751;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct whispering]
752;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct whispering fades]
753;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;You are the one with the wishes.
754;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[faint indistinct whispering]
755;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts and whimpers]
756;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Make your wish!
757;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Do it now!
758;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I don't-- I don't know! I...
759;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I wish very badly to leave this place forever.

766;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer continues chanting in Elder]
767;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh, Geralt. Thank the gods. I might live to see another day.
768;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;We need to go.
769;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Jaskier, you're okay.
770;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I'm glad to hear that you give a monkey's about it.
771;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Let's not jump to conclusions.
772;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;What happened?
773;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, I was having a rather lovely dream which then turned into a nightmare.
774;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;There were naked women in both parts.
775;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;The first one was loving, tender, very generous.
776;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;The second, significantly more terrifying.
777;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Tell me about the second one.
778;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, black hair, devilish eyes, was painting an amphora on her abdomen.
779;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;You know, the usual.
780;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;She wants to be the vessel.
781;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What, you know this woman? Of course you know this woman.
782;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;She wants to become more powerful.
783;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;But she'll die.
784;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Well, let's pray for her on our way out of town.
785;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh...
786;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Are you perhaps short of a marble?
787;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;You have to go in there, don't you?
788;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;I recognize the look. I know how you feel.
789;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;You're making me uncomfortable.
790;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Do not tell me that this is finally the moment
791;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;you've decided to actually care about someone other than yourself?
792;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Leave the very sexy but insane witch to her inevitable demise!
793;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;She saved your life, Jaskier. I can't let her die.
794;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[sighs]
795;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer speaking Elder]
796;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[groans]
797;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Don't!
798;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;I'm here to help you.
799;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
800;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I don't need your help.
801;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You're free.
802;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;No longer under my spell.
803;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;[Geralt] And yet,
804;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;here I am.
805;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You seem to want to meet your end.
806;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;As do you.
807;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
808;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cracking]
809;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The djinn isn't weakening.
810;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;The bard expressed his last wish,
811;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;but it's... [screams]
812;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cracking]
813;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] It's getting stronger!
814;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Go!
815;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;That's because I'm the one with the wishes.
816;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[djinn muttering faintly]
817;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You?
818;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[gasps] You're the djinn's master?
819;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[djinn growling]
820;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Yeah.
821;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Well, what are you waiting for? [screams]
822;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cracking]
823;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Make your wishes!
824;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Becoming the vessel for the djinn will have you lose control,
825;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;not gain it!
826;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasping]
827;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Can't you see what this is doing to you?
828;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;True transformation is painful.
829;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Release the djinn!
830;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;I'll give you my last wish!
831;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You heroic protector...
832;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[cracking]
833;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;...noble dog,
834;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;permitting my success so long as you command it yourself.
835;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[screams] Fuck off!
836;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I'll do this myself!
837;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[crunching]
838;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Damn it, Yennefer! Tell me what you want!
839;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I want everything! [screams]
840;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
841;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[screaming]
842;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[thunder rumbling]

844;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;Sir, what's going on in that house?
845;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;My house. And...
846;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Beau Berrant;I have no idea!
847;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[in distorted voice] Make your wish! You can have anything you want!
848;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You could choose not to be a witcher.
849;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What do you desire?
850;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Immortality?
851;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Riches?
852;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Fame?
853;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Power?

862;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] Wh--
863;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Where did it go?
864;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[creaking]
865;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[gasps]
866;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;[Chireadan] Are you sure they were up there?
867;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;This can't be happening.
868;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;This can't be happening.
869;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;She could not have survived it.
870;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Why did Geralt go in there? It doesn't make any sense.
871;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What, to save a mad fucking witch? Why?
872;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Because she was magnificent.
873;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer screams]
874;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Geralt panting]
875;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Yennefer?
876;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Yennefer.
877;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;It's me...  Geralt.
878;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[grunts]
879;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I know who you are.
880;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[shakily] What did you do?
881;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You stopped me, didn't you?
882;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I nearly had it.
883;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;[Geralt] You had shit all.
884;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I saved your life!
885;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;[Yennefer] And I saved yours!
886;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You let the djinn escape.
887;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Who knows what havoc it'll wreak now that it has no vessel at all?
888;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;[Geralt] No more havoc than you.
889;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Djinns are only dark creatures when held captive.
890;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;How can you be so sure?
891;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;When did you last feel happy when you felt trapped?
892;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;And if you were going to portal us to safety,
893;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;you could've taken us out of this shit town!
894;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;A fine critique if you could make a portal yourself.
895;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;It wasn't a shit town,  it was fine till you came along.
896;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I had a plan!
897;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;[chuckles] And that was going swimmingly!
898;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;It was.
899;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Like a drowning fish.
900;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[breathing heavily]
901;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Yennefer gasps]
902;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;What am I supposed to do now, hm?
903;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;It wasn't supposed to go this way.
904;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I'm gonna write you...
905;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;the best song...
906;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;so that everyone remembers who you were,
907;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;what we did,
908;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;everything we saw.
909;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;And I will sing it...
910;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;for the rest of my days.
911;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;He always said I had the most wonderful singing voice.
912;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;They're alive.
913;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Bollocks.
914;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Geralt?
915;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[laughs]
916;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;Oh, they're alive.
917;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;They're really alive! Whoo!
918;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Jaskier;I mean, he...
919;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Come on.
920;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Chireadan;Whoa, hang on!
921;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[both panting]
922;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;I was right about you.
923;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You do know something of pleasure.
924;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Fleeting,
925;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;but highly effective, I'll admit.
926;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;I was right about you too.
927;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Which part?
928;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;There was a number of things. Which part?
929;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;Doesn't matter.
930;1;5;Bottled Appetites;geralt;My plan worked.
931;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;There was no plan.
932;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;You were making it up as you went along.
933;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Any fool could see.
934;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;What did you wish for?
935;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Tell me.
936;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Yennefer;Geralt?
937;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[rustling]
938;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[indistinct whispering]
939;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;[Dryad echoing] Weapons, weapons...
940;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[rustling]
941;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[bird call]
942;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;[in Elder] Someone's coming.
943;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[arrow strikes]
944;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;[doppler, in English] Stop, please!
945;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;I've come for the girl.
946;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;You try.
947;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;[Eithne, in Elder] Who enters our forest?
948;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;[Dryad General, in Elder]  He claims he knows the child.
949;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;Mousesack!
950;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;[Mousesack] Your Highness.
951;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;[Ciri] What are you doing, silly?
952;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;Dara, this is Mousesack. He's known me since I was born. He's like...
953;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Dara;Like family.
954;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;[Ciri] What happened to you?
955;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;Where did you go on that street?
956;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;What matters is I've found my way back to you.
957;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;I've come to take you to your rightful place.
958;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;Ciri has chosen to stay with us.
959;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;It was her grandmother's dying wish
960;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;that she should go to Geralt of Rivia.
961;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Doppler;I know where to find him.
962;1;5;Bottled Appetites;dryad;She's been promised to him through the Law of Surprise.
963;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;You've been so kind to me,
964;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;but Mousesack is all I have left of home.
965;1;5;Bottled Appetites;;[Mousesack chuckles]
966;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;[Ciri] Maybe...
967;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;he's the other edge of my destiny.
968;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Dara;And you can come with us.
969;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Dara;Are you sure about leaving?
970;1;5;Bottled Appetites;ciri;I need answers.
971;1;5;Bottled Appetites;ciri;And I need you.
972;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;You're my family too now, remember?
973;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;The burden of power...
974;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;can be painful.
975;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Be vigilant.
976;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Always ask the right questions.
977;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Your destiny is...
978;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;in your own hands and no one else's.
979;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;Farewell,
980;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Eithne;special one.
981;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;[Ciri] Thank you.
982;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;For everything.
983;1;5;Bottled Appetites;Ciri;Bye.
