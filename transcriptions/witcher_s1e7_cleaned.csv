0,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] Where would you be headin', little thief?"
1,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Skellige.
2,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Hmm.
3,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
4,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know how long it is to the coast?
5,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With a fast horse,"
6,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,about a week.
7,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And what about by foot?
8,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
9,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You need to be careful, child."
10,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This place isn't safe if you're alone.
11,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then it's the same as every other place.
12,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[faint drumbeat]
13,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird calls]
14,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[stirring music plays]
15,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rhythmic marching]
16,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men calling out]
17,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men yelling]
18,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
19,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door clanks shut]
20,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Out of nowhere, you send word to meet you."
21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"All this time, I thought you were dead."
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I told you last time I was in Cintra that I wasn't coming back.
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yet here you are.
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt grunts softly]
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Why?
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've come for your Child of Surprise...
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,haven't you?
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The opposite.
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want you to tell me that he's safe and healthy so I can keep on riding.
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He...
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is a girl.
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Princess Cirilla has been raised by Calanthe since her parents died.
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Pavetta and Duny's ship was lost at sea.
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you been hiding your head in the sand?
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why now?
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why do you think she's not safe?
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saw an army making camp at the Amell Pass.
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A sea of black and gold.
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Nilfgaard is set on sweeping the Continent.
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But since that night at Pavetta's banquet,"
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the Queen's done everything she can to keep her family safe from threats.
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shut the walls.
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fortified the gates.
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[running footsteps]
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sent assassins!
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Were you followed?
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No!
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[clattering]
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rattling]
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm?
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You want me, you kill him first!"
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt!
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do something!
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is on your Queen.
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will both die.
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Blame destiny.
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all yelling]
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[theme music playing]
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Nilfgaardians don't strike me as foolish.
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Coming at us now would be right stupid.
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The army whose stink I can smell  on a strong breeze is one I worry about.
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So we prepare, same as always."
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When does the King return from Skellige, Your Majesty?"
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This morning. Be good to see that craggy face.
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Be better to see the 50 ships the Skelligens promised.
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesty.
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No offense taken, Danek."
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know I agree.
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We've taken on every pissant pretender for a dozen years.
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If Nilfgaard need to learn the lesson the rest of them have,"
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,we'll be ready for them.
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want reports from the Amell Pass every hour...
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guards drawing swords]
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I warned you about coming back.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've been away 12 years and I'd planned on staying that way...
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,till you sent eight men to kill me.
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, I'm asking you now."
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do not do this.
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you treated me more like a friend than a threat...
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know the difference anymore?
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm here
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to protect the girl.
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who I've raised as my own.
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why would I give my only heir
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to someone who never cared enough to come back for her?
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Move along, Witcher. I'll pay whatever you want."
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't be bought.
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should remember.
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Money can't undo the Law of Surprise.
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kings who've tried to outbid destiny
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,end up on pikes.
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And if I win the war but lose Ciri,"
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,what victory is that?
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[swords clanking]
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Maybe that army won't come, and if they do, maybe you'll be ready."
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But if you have any doubt in your mind that she's safe here,"
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,give her to me.
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Call it destiny, security, what larger forces at work,"
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't care.
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I will take her, protect her,"
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and bring her back unharmed, I promise you that."
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ciri is all I have left of my daughter.
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If Ciri survives, then Pavetta lives on too."
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Law of Surprise has been called.
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll tell Cirilla myself.
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, sweet Cintra, you were so promising,"
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,from your spoiled princess to your stupid old king!
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But when I arrived, the royals were dead!"
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tossed out a window or shot in the head!
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[devil puppet] So, what to do now? Where's the devil to go?"
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Anywhere but here. Back in your hole!
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[devil puppet] No, don't cast me out on a whim!"
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who needs you when I've got him?
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[devil puppet shouting]
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[donkey braying]
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Hey!
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where'd you get a piece like this?
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was my mother's.
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[woman] Hey, girl!"
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's so special about Skellige?
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Those roads aren't safe,"
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and the Skelligens are a grumpy lot.
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How about this?
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come with me.
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've got one more thing to buy.
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and then we'll make room on Clip and Clop
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and be home by dark.
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We don't have much, but we've got a sight more than you do."
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Roof,"
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"food, space on the floor to sleep."
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A lot's happening on this Continent, but we're safer when we stick together."
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Okay?
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Grand.
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[neighs]
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Calanthe] It's what has been promised.
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must sacrifice... to fulfill destiny.
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shh...
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sobs]
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door slams shut]
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He may take you,"
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but you will always be mine.
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sniffles]
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I need you to be brave now, because who are you?"
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Lion Cub of Cintra.
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Pleased to meet you, Princess."
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can I say goodbye to my friends now?
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Of course.
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll summon you when she's ready.
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whooshing]
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crashing]
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[metallic rattling]
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rattling stops]
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[flies buzzing]
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighing]
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chatter]
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[boy] Go on, Korin, do it! Oh! Gimme."
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Korin, Anton, I have to go."
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What? No!
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know!
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Anton] Take care.
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Highness.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[boys laughing]
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Anton] Throw those knuckles.
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First, you try to kill me, then you lie to me."
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm just trying to keep Cirilla safe.
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ciri is safe, with me, until the day she takes over my throne."
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Listen to me.
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did listen once.
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let a hedgehog into my court.
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It got me Pavetta dead.
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I won't lose Ciri too.
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So you and destiny can both fuck right off.
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Because if Nilfgaard comes, will destiny carry a banner into battle?"
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We have an army, a navy..."
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and me.
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A dynasty can't survive on arrogance alone.
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Says a witcher.
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She needs family.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know nothing about that.
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your own mother cared so little, she discarded you."
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You lecture me on a mother's love yet offer up someone else's daughter.
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Queen to all of Cintra, grandmother to one."
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I won't orphan that girl.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're sentencing her to death.
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What did I miss?
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothing.
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get him out of my sight.
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I remember when you honored the Law of Surprise.
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What changed?
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had a granddaughter.
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So protect her.
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesty.
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if Calanthe's wrong?
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if they come and Ciri is trapped?
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I fight side by side with my Queen.
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You put too much faith in that woman.
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, you weren't there."
208,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"After Pavetta died, Calanthe would wake up howling in the night."
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Lioness, nearly broken."
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Someone who's able to pull themselves out of that,"
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they'll have my confidence till my final day.
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I need your promise you won't come back.
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I hear Ciri's in danger,"
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you know I can't do that.
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know.
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men yelling]
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[tools scraping and hacking]
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Just move it!
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Faster!
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 2] That's right! No water till you've finished!
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 3] Move it!
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 4] That's right!
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man 5] All right, ditch diggers!"
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 6] Move it!
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 5] Report any findings immediately!
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All visitors must declare themselves to the officers!
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is it cleared yet?
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sentry] Safe conduct?
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're coming from Caingorn?
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How long will you be in Nazair?
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That is yet to be determined.
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Hello, Yennefer."
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckling] The... the runes described a...
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"a magnalith"" in Nazair,"
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Until Nilfgaard tore through all the lands.
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They allow my research.
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's all I care about.
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm. A man of principle.
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't understand.  Every glyph has a clue
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to something across the Continent...
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...from a time before the Conjunction.
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Most are history, but some might be more."
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The prophecy, the future, I want to explore all of it."
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles] Wow.
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's a face. You hate it that much?
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Only because I have taste buds.
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, these people were starving before Nilfgaard."
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"See, most kings only care about their cocks and their coffers."
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They look out for their people. Everybody gets something.
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The same thing,"
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which tastes as if someone pissed in my cup.
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sounds to me like you bought in.
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No. No, it's, uh..."
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's just that...
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"sometimes, boring is better."
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, it's not."
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come on.
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] How long do you see yourself here?
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's a lot of hill left to dig. Why?
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because I may be missing you.
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both chuckle]
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"See, the Yennefer I remember didn't miss anyone."
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, well..."
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if...
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it's not too late for what we talked about in the cave?
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We could go somewhere with,"
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I don't know, two types of ale."
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You could...
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"play with your rocks,"
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and I'll work as a mage.
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You hate monoliths.
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, but--"
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But what?
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, look at you. You could have anyone."
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have.
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And it was fun to be wanted.
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The object of desire.
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"After where I came from, I lapped it up."
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But they all loved the power that came with my position at court.
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not my power.
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And no one's ever seen that but me?
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs deeply]
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know,"
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I spent...
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I spent years...
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,waiting for this moment where you realized we're meant for each other.
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, coming up with excuses to study at Aedirn."
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Henges, dead languages, anything to get closer to you again, and...."
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,every request I made was denied.
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You shut them all down.
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs softly]
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Stregobor, of all people, snapped me out of it."
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Forget about the girl.
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Remembered why I loved it. The beauty, the purity. No..."
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,distractions when I'm in it.
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You went after the thing you loved.
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sorry you chose power.
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sniffles]
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,At least you kept your eyes.
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs shakily]
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,His loss.
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Piss off.
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, I would, but we don't have much time."
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who the fuck are you?
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispering] I'm Vilgefortz of Roggeveen.
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why are you whispering?
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard is conscripting mages like us into their service.
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Now, since..."
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Now, since I don't have a letter of safe conduct,"
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and yours is probably fake, we should go,"
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,before those lads start asking questions.
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go where?
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Vilgefortz] Aretuza.
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Vilgefortz] Well, the feeling's mutual."
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Chapter thinks you're rash,"
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,unpredictable and dangerous.
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But right now,"
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that's exactly what Tissaia and I need.
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tissaia asked for me?
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She said you're the best student she ever taught.
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Vilgefortz] Let's talk.
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,About what?
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard.
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Their army's camped near Cintra, and we think they're going to attack."
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And they won't stop there.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We need allies from the Northern Kingdoms.
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll leave this to the people who actually give a shit. Where's Tissaia?
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Vilgefortz] Tissaia can wait.
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fine, I'll just follow the sound of crying girls."
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Vilgefortz] She has no idea you're here.
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You said she asked for me.
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I told you that she said you were her best student.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm the one that wants you here.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It took five minutes for the lies to start.
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did I expect anything else from a place held together by bullshit?
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia, echoing] Do you know how many people wouldn't blink if you died?"
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[young Yennefer] Let me out!
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thumping on door]
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let me out!
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia] Sometimes, the best thing a flower can do for us is die."
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] You should've let me die.
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,At least I had control over that.
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia] Mm, that's adorable, piglet."
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girls giggling]
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia] You weren't taking control,"
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you were losing it.
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[echoing] You were losing it.
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What the hell's going on in here?
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girl] We were studying. Botany.
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I gave Rectress de Vries  your pitiful excuse about that pitiful plant,"
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'd be gone by nightfall.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs softly]
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But fuck that old bag!
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girls laugh hesitantly]
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This was my room.
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Before anyone you know was born.
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, you've been to court?"
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aedirn.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's very elegant.
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Very boring.
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Why are you back, then?"
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why am I back?
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I bet you hate botany as much as I did.
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who wants to know what those herbs are really good for?
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rhwydwaith carthion.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They've taught you about its healing powers
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and fortifying blah, blah, blah."
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But they leave out  that if you mix these two together,"
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you'll see colors like never...
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,before.
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Miss tells us never to mix herbs.
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They tell you that so you have to go to them for all the answers.
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A word of advice.
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Think for yourselves.
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It'll save you a lifetime of heartbreak.
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girl] The ceiling's melting.
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] No.
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The herbs are working.
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[giggling]
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[girl, echoing] Well, I don't feel..."
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What was I saying?
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Gods, you're pretty."
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, don't worry, Fola."
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll look like that too.
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nobody starts off that way.
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You want to know a secret?
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nobody starts off that way.
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's overrated.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Look, I'm levitating!"
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[echoing] Levitating, I'm levitating."
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yennefer] Glacella, whatever you lack in talent, you make up for in confidence."
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fola] She doesn't need confidence. Her father owns half of Creyden.
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So he could swap a hundred horses for her spot here.
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[giggling]
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your parents paid Aretuza?
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Chapter decided it needed students from the best families.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you all must have had a conduit moment?
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We shouldn't be mixing herbs. We shouldn't even be here.
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, if they catch us, they really will expel us."
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are far worse things than expulsion.
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like what?
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What is this place?
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Aretuza's windmill.
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Enough bridled chaos to keep the curtains hung...
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and the torches lit, but that's not what we're here for."
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Glacella] I think we should go.
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fola] Wait. I've got so many questions.
417,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] You want to know more.
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fola] Yes.
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everything.
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The ability to create life,"
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"real life,"
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they take that from you.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And then send you out,"
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"so the only family, the only loyalty you have,"
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is to them.
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you'll trade it all for what?
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Looks that never change.
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A court full of idiots.
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you don't have to do it.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But what if I want to?
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're leaving. Come on.
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lesson's not over yet!
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Just because you fucked up, doesn't mean we will."
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You?
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come on.
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With all the magical talent of shoe leather?
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You'll have a home here forever, Glacella."
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right here.
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With my sisters who never ascended.
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[ringing sound]
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's happening?
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Anica, is that you?"
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[young Yennefer] You turned my friend into a slug.
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] An eel.
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come, push your friend into the pool."
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yennefer] I don't care what you do, but remember this."
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Even if you do everything right,"
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"follow their rules,"
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that's still no guarantee you'll get what you want.
450,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] Enough!
451,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Back to your rooms, girls."
452,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer sighs]
453,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs softly]
454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You ruined one life.
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stop there.
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] I never even wanted to come back here!
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[sighs] Then you failed at that, too."
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Look at this place.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a joke.
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Letting in girls who can't even do magic!
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sometimes, you have to compromise in order to survive."
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You say I never took responsibility for the way my life turned out.
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What about you?
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girl] But what's happening? I don't understand...
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] What's going on?
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] It's happening.
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Triss!
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer.
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I tried finding you for years.
470,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why are you all here?
471,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,An emergency conclave of the Northern Mages.
472,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
473,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're attacking Cintra.
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Artorius] Going to war against Nilfgaard is madness.
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And for Cintra?
477,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They've rejected our mages for decades, so let's grant them their wish."
478,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not just about Cintra.
479,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard won't be satisfied until they have the whole Continent.
480,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And how do you know this?
481,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because that's the same lie I would tell.
482,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm the only one here that's led soldiers into battle.
483,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, yes, and don't we know it?"
484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You wear your silly costume
485,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,every chance you get.
486,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[mages laugh]
487,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All those years swinging his sword around were years he wasn't serving as a mage.
488,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or killing babies born at an eclipse.
489,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[murmuring]
490,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We can stop Nilfgaard, if we act now."
491,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The south... well, is the south."
492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is up to the north to unite.
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is time to convince our kings to send their armies.
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They could cross the Yaruga,"
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,make it to Sodden by week's end.
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They could save Cintra.
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If Cintra falls, who cares?"
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[muttering]
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] I care!
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because our kingdoms will be next.
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Our fight is with Cintra, and only Cintra."
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"In Nilfgaard, we know what it's like to have corrupt leaders."
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But under our new leader, Emperor Emhyr, we've changed."
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We've strengthened trade.
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We've funded research.
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We have torn down walls,"
508,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,whilst Queen Calanthe has done nothing but put them up.
509,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am not here to defend Cintra.
510,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I will defend our way of life.
511,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Brotherhood, the Academies,"
512,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the order that we have built up over centuries.
513,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You've rejected it all, Fringilla."
514,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla] Not true. We've modified it.
515,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Most of us came from Aretuza and Ban Ard.
516,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We've simply charted a different path,"
517,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,guided by the White Flame.
518,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That makes us cousins, not enemies."
519,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You force mages into servitude!
520,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Fringilla] When in training, yes.  Like soldiers."
521,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We believe in shared sacrifice.
522,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Triss] You also believe in forbidden magic.
523,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Demonology, necromancy, fire magic!"
524,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla] Forbidden magic is one of the ghost stories taught to us here.
525,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is no such thing as dark or light magic.
526,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
527,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla] Nothing in this world is as simple as that.
528,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You think that we're destroying the Continent.
529,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We know that if we take Cintra, we have a chance of saving it."
530,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you won't take sides, then at least stay out of our way."
531,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Stregobor] Ah, enough of this tiring debate."
532,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cintra's a lost cause.
533,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let them reap what they sow.
534,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I say we vote.
535,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, vote. Vote!"
536,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Vote?
537,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First, you install your niece at Nilfgaard,"
538,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and now you want to ram through a vote.
539,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Fringilla] To be fair, Yennefer of Vengerberg"
540,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is the one I have to thank for my posting.
541,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If she had taken it, I wouldn't be where I am today."
542,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Neither would Nilfgaard.
543,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If only Yennefer had gone to Nilfgaard.
544,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With her at the helm, they'd still be a shitty backwater."
545,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
546,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're right.
547,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Instead, I went to a prized kingdom and did fuck all for decades."
548,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just as you taught us.
549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Helped murderers and rapists keep their crown.
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe it is time for something different.
551,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pipe down. You-- you don't get a vote.
552,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I did, I'd vote to burn it all down."
553,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[clamoring]
554,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There! There you have--
555,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There you have it!
556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] It's true.
557,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cintra has chosen to turn its back on us.
558,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They are proud, and smart, and difficult, yes."
559,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I'd wager above all else...
560,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they are scared.
561,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] It's true.
562,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have called them a lost cause for years.
563,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But we stopped trying too.
564,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And it is time now...
565,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"that we risk not only our lives, but our pride,"
566,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and try again.
567,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct murmuring]
568,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With your permission,"
569,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,all those in favor
570,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of letting Cintra continue their proud tradition
571,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of fending for themselves?
572,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Well...
573,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,there you have it.
574,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
575,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I know you hate this place, but there are girls who need it."
576,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Those who have only ever known chaos until we teach them control.
577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You were right, in Rinde."
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aretuza is all I have.
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If Nilfgaard wins...
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chatter]
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
582,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[softly] That's why Vilgefortz and I and some others are going to fight.
583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should join us.
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you hear a word I just said?
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why would I protect this?
586,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you will not do it for the Brotherhood, then do it for me."
587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Please.
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you ever used that word before?
589,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Mousesack] Your Majesty,"
590,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the Nilfgaardians will breach the castle gates.
591,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Have breached.
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now what?
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What do we do?
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[keys clattering]
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Witcher...
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I couldn't let him go.
600,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know what I've done.
601,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's in the gate keep.
602,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If I can bring him here...
603,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to Ciri...
604,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,destiny may yet side with us.
605,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Danek.
606,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's time.
607,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Wait, where are you going?"
608,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt!
609,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
610,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man yells]
611,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesty...
612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispers] He's gone.
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Looks like he's escaped.
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If he is out there,"
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then there is still hope for her.
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What is it?
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lazlo, bring her cloak."
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What? No!
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Continue to be brave. Promise me.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are the Lion Cub of Cintra.
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are destined for great things.
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't do this without you.
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We must go, Your Highness."
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams] No!
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rattling]
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[softly] Go.
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The world depends on it.
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[softly] I love you.
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Find Geralt of Rivia.
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He is your destiny.
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Lazlo] We must go, Your Highness."
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thuds]
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exhales sharply]
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Princess, come."
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
637,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me what I want to know and you'll live.
638,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing heavily]
639,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am already saved.
640,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt sighs]
641,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
642,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
643,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where is Cirilla?
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No one... is left.
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpers]
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah... we shall be born anew. [wheezes]
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thus it shall be.
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Watch for the signs.
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What signs these shall be I say unto--
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[squelches]
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cicadas chirping]
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse whinnies]
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loon calls]
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri] I should've traded that ring for food.
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're right, Clop."
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or are you Clip?
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whinnies]
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[laughs] Gods, what kind of crazy person talks to a horse?"
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[twig snaps]
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse nickers]
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[frog croaking]
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse whinnies]
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird calling]
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse nickering]
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's all right.
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's all right. We're Cintrans.
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[twigs cracking]
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse whinnying]
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Anton!
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps] You made it out. You're all right!
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I told you it was her at the market.
