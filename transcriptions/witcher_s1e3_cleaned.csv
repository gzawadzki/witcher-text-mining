0,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[boy] It comes on a full moon...
1,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to feed.
2,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's what Ma used to say.
3,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When a wolf...
4,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,crosses a maiden's grave.
5,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A pregnant girl who died before her time.
6,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That babe...
7,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,starts growing...
8,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,right in her belly.
9,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[dust scatters]
10,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[blows]
11,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
12,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When it's big enough...
13,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that babe rips out.
14,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Only it ain't a babe no more.
15,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a monster.
16,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A vukodlak.
17,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I swear, Witcher, that's what got me."
18,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I swear I saw it.
19,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I swear on my ma's grave, I saw it--"
20,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Shh. Shh, shh."
21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Three thousand orens. Up front.
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams]
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[echoing scream]
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[metal clinking]
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[hook creaks]
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loud screech]
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] No!
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman screaming]
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[metal clinking]
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loud screech]
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This... [chuckles] I definitely know.
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ The vampiress bled ♪
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ As white as a sheet ♪
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ And yet her dead heart did beat ♪
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ Did beat ♪
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The kikimora?
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mm.
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't recall the bard  singing of this one.
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who would dare  try and rob you of your treasure?
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A woman?
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Princess.
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Were you in love?
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's her name?
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When you live as long as I do, all the names start to sound the same."
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[sighs] Were destiny a kinder bitch,  a whore like me"
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,wouldn't have to settle for  her client's telltales.
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A friend of yours came through here last month headed for Temeria.
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Friend?
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Another witcher.
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mm. Blessed that prick with my fullest efforts, too,"
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and he--
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's in Temeria?
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you not just hear me talking?
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shouldn't you know
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,when someone's pretending?
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[pounding on door]
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] It's been three nights.
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pay up or get out!
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Temeria?
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] It's got a pest problem.
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A few miners rounded up 3,000 orens to have it killed."
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your boy took the coin and ran.
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[banging on door]
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] You hear me?
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[banging continues]
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you... for...
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,everything.
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Witcher!
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[banging persists]
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What about the room?
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door crashes open]
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snorts]
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[nickers]
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't judge me.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll be back with payment in a few days.
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Anything happens to my horse...
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles] You don't scare me.
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Point me to Temeria.
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Years of attacks by this creature, and the king does nothing."
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must force his hand. Lay down our picks...
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and refuse to work.
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all] Yeah.
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And a half-measure ain't gonna do! We've got to move on.
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Plenty of work south of Sodden.
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[others mutter]
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[metal clanks]
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My son...
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,rest his soul...
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,told me...
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in Nilfgaard...
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the king diddled whores while his subjects starved.
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then someone came.
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Usurper.
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And he rallied the people, and they took back what was theirs!"
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all] Yeah!
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I say we follow their lead!
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] You can't kill the vukodlak...
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so you decide to kill your king?
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Great plan.
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Another fuckin' witcher.
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your kind already swindled us once.
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I take payment after the job is done and for a third of the price.
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,An apology...
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,from my guild...
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to yours.
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And if you can't kill it?
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then I die.
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Please.
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everyone remain calm.
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lower your weapons and return to your homes.
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do so quickly and without further theatrics...
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and you have my word that our king  will not hear of this treason.
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest commits treason.
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He hides in his winter castle as we are eaten.
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all] Yeah!
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mikal was a good boy.
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Revenge will not ease your pain.
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[spits]
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all yell]
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know nothing...
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of my pain.
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Does Foltest have a plan?
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,See this one to our borders.
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Temeria's had their fill... of witchers.
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[neighing]
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witcher.
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can put down your sword. I'm not here to hurt you.
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Says the witch hiding in the woods.
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sorceress.
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witch.
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Triss Merigold.  I serve King Foltest.
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So he makes a show of kicking me out...
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then sends his errand girl to slip me some coin
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so I kill his monster.
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not a very original plan for a king.
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's my plan.
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My coin.
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I don't want you to kill the beast.
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want you to help me save it.
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Six years ago,"
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,stable hands started vanishing at the castle above the city.
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Before long, citizens were disappearing throughout all Temeria."
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest's royal guards soon realized the creature was coming from the crypt
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,where the king's sister Adda is buried.
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rumor has it she was having an affair  with a young man in town when she died.
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Was she pregnant?
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If she were, that would make her child the sole heir to the throne"
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,as Foltest never married.
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The king fled the castle, ignoring the rising death toll."
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"After Nilfgaard overthrew their king,"
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"the Brotherhood  couldn't risk it happening again,"
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so they sent me here three months ago to cure the creature.
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Vukodlaks are freak mutations.
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They can't be cured.
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good thing it's not a vukodlak.
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Two thousand orens if you can tell me what exactly killed these people.
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You didn't want the people to know that it bested a witcher.
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you let them believe that he fled with their coin.
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You two clearly weren't acquainted.
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,His heart's missing along with his liver.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Only one creature I know is that picky an eater.
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A striga.
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Strigas are old wives' tales.
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're very rare.
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The only way to make one is through a curse.
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Someone wanted Adda dead.
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mm-hmm.
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the curse didn't stop with Adda. It turned her daughter into a monster.
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Her daughter?
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Strigas are female.
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This striga's a princess.
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighing]
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh... can... can...
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Uh, can they do something?"
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Uh, they-- they're just watching."
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was a nice touch with the applause.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So how many more times do you think we get to do this?
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't know.
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Soon you'll be off to your ruins, dashing explorer."
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Part-time dashing explorer.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stregebor says Temeria leans heavily on its mages.
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So maybe you'll be too busy for me.
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or maybe you'll be too busy for me once you get a taste of Aedirn revelry.
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,King Virfuril is handsome. Allegedly.
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If I do a good job...
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can persuade him to give you access to our ruins.
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe we'll do this forever.
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah.
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, after the initiation today, we're in charge."
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We get to make the decisions, be who we want to be."
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's wrong?
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fringilla and the others  see their ideal selves so clearly.
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They know exactly what they want for their enchantments.
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stop worrying so much.
208,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Easy for a Ban Ard boy.
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You dolts needn't change a single wrinkle before heading to court.
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What do you want?
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Remember that scared girl  who tumbled at your feet in this cave...
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,totally unaware of her power?
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want to go back home to Aedirn and never be her again.
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're bound for Aedirn?
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Let me be candid. You are a... first draft of what nature intended, yes?"
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lucky for you, I'm the final artist."
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Every girl I enchant  leaves Aretuza a living work of art.
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm?
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No matter how challenging the clay.
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snap]
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perfect for Aedirn.
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A gray dress assumes importance without bald ambition.
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah. Not the final look. More a preview.
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is not a person alive
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that does not look into the mirror and see some deformity.
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Except for us.
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We remake ourselves on our terms. The world has no say in it.
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Look.
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can free the victim in the mirror forever.
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't know where to begin.
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Close your eyes.
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I said close them.
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Imagine the most powerful woman in the world.
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Her hair, the color of her eyes, yes..."
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but also the strength of her posture.
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The poise of her entire being.
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you see her?
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Open your eyes.
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She is stunning.
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Miss Merigold, you were dispatched  to settle a family affair,"
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,not to enlist a mutant mercenary for a game of sleuthing.
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"This is no game, Captain. Tonight is a full moon,"
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and Geralt has already proved himself  to be invaluable.
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We believe we can cure the creature.
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You say she's a girl.
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then you will refer to her as Her Royal Highness.
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Segelin, I believe urgency"
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,warrants flexibility in court decorum.
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The witcher's theory is nonsense. Princess Adda was the people's angel.
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who'd wish to murder her?
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What about her lover?
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Seditious rumors. Idle courtesans  trading out boredom for jealousy.
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Perhaps if you called off your guards,"
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"if we were able to search the abandoned castle,"
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,we could find clues as to who cursed her.
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Segelin] Except this witcher  would kill the princess as she sleeps,"
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and collect the miners' coin.
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Call her a princess.
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Call her a unicorn if you'd like to.
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She grew inside Adda, feeding on her petrified womb."
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you no respect?
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mutating.
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Growing for years  till she got so hungry...
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,she was forced to slither out.
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Rotten muscle, bent bones, two spidery legs,"
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,claws dragging in the dirt. An overgrown abortion.
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Enough.
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[soldier] Your Highness?
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave.
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guard] Hey!
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Open the door!
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[banging]
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Open this door! Protect the king!
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling and banging continues]
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guard] Witcher!
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who's the princess' father?
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"My men will kill you, Witcher."
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm. It's funny.
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You learn that your sister was murdered, and you didn't even flinch."
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the moment I mention the girl's father...
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why were you never married?
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are speaking to a king.
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That is exactly my point.
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why not produce your own heir?
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why not kill the striga  and avoid this revolt?
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why drag this all out?
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Between you and me...
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who is the striga's father?
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I remember hearing stories about witchers when I was a child.
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is it true what they say?
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thump on door]
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That the mutations that grant you your... abilities
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,also erase your emotions?
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guards yell]
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Must be.
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,'Cause only a man devoid of all heart
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,could accuse a brother of bedding his murdered sister
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,while urging him to kill her.
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave Temeria.
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Never return.
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] Cintra continues their animosity towards our organization.
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Artorius] Don't tell me  they're employing druids
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or worse--fortune tellers.
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"King Dagorad has banned mages from Cintra, God knows why."
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've heard rumors he's taken ill.
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Now, if the king dies, perhaps his heiress will be more pliable. Princess..."
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Calanthe? Good luck with that.
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Word is she's even more stubborn than her father is.
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How fares Nilfgaard?
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,King Fergus is proving to be an effective and excitable young king.
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Horny, she means."
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Spending the kingdom's money on women as his people starve to death.
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fringilla will be in Nilfgaard by week's end.
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She will bring sanity and bread to the people.
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your girl is-- With all due respect,"
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,your niece is only capable of doing what she's told.
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No ambitious mage wants to be assigned anywhere south of Sodden.
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But Nilfgaard needs correcting.
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps we consider sending someone there with a bit more... spine.
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Stregobor, did you have anyone in mind?"
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What about your hunchback protégé?
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How's her... spine?
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We agreed Yennefer would thrive in Aedirn.
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"King Virfuril  prefers mages from his kingdom,"
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and Yennefer was born in Vengerberg.
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, we'd be spitting in Dagorad's face"
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,if we send Yennefer to their biggest trade partner.
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The only thing Cintra hates more than mages is... elves.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer's of elven blood?
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Quarter elf.
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Watch a Cintran do that math.
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let's not model our wisdom on prejudice and paranoia.
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Prejudiced or not, you can't deny"
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cintra has operated outside our influence far too long.
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Stregobor] Unchecked kings and queens lead to rebellions. Massacres.
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's the reason this chapter was formed.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Still afraid of Falka, are you?"
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And you, you spare your niece her duties?"
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not enough fragrance in Toussaint to take the stench off that nepotism.
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Let the Chapter vote, then. I'll even recuse myself."
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All in favor of Yennefer to Nilfgaard instead of Fringilla?
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your Excellence, it's an honor."
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The honor is mine.
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,King Fergus chose this.
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not me.
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,King Fergus of Nilfgaard?
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are you talking about?
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I demand an audience with the Chapter.
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I handle court assignments, Yennefer."
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not the Chapter.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You promised me Aedirn.
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,New items came to light which led me to believe
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that you would be a better fit for Nilfgaard.
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"There's no power in puppeting fools,"
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,especially one who'd sooner fondle his sorceress than listen to her!
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't think new items came to light.
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I think the Chapter overruled you.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is that it? Yeah?
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The all-powerful sorceress Tissaia de Vriess
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,knocked down from her glass pedestal.
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,'Twas your blood.
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Efforts in Cintra prevent the Brotherhood
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,from placing a mage with elven blood in Aedirn's court.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How could you tell them?
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did not.
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stregobor did.
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Divine the rest.
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door closes]
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crows cawing]
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rattling]
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crows cawing]
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How many more hours?
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Too many.
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Triss] You were told to leave Temeria.
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But come on.
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,These views.
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you going to kill her?
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't want the miners' coin.
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Or mine, apparently."
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What is this girl to you?
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why do you care?
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You first.
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saw how Foltest and his boy  spoke to you.
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why help those who won't listen?
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm sure someone as legendary as you
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,has already figured out several ways to get past Segelin's guards.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thud]
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Move away.
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Temeria reeks of secrets. I could sense them.
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just like I could these bodies before we entered.
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I imagine you sense them, too."
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest and Adda. What happened to them?
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not answering questions is a pillar of your brooding charm.
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pretty sure Foltest is the father.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Triss] Adda's bedroom.
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you think he cursed her?
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest?
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe.
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[inhales]
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimsical tune plays]
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[note plays]
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[notes play]
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt.
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Letters.
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"From Queen Sancia,  Foltest and Adda's mother."
417,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A Queen Mother cursing her own children for their affair.
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This could destroy the throne.
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sancia wanted Adda to get rid of the child.
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It seems she refused. Repeatedly.
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And now she's taken that curse with her to the grave.
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've served the family for decades.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Was Sancia involved in  dark sorcery of any kind?
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No. Of course not.
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What was your relationship to Adda?
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, I like to think that she saw me as a confidant."
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And protector, even."
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We used to talk at great length about her troubles.
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She could be very naive.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She ever mention her brother?
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Certainly not like this.
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She was ashamed.
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or she was frightened.
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if the relationship was not...
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,consensual?
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You think he raped Adda, then cursed the child to cover it up?"
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, kings have done more for less."
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,True.
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[sighs] There's only one wrinkle, though."
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your scent was on her sheets.
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt.
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Old ones...
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and new ones.
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What would I be doing in a dead girl's bed?
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I smelled what you were doing.
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest had no right!
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He seduced Adda. Abused his position.
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He was always nagging her  for attention.
450,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Always nagging!
451,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But he didn't love her.
452,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did.
453,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You cursed the woman you loved?
454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I cursed Foltest, not her."
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Countless are dead because of your jealousy.
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Countless are dead because of Foltest!
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He spoiled Adda with his seed.
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He refuses to kill this striga.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He lies to his people. And yet you wag your finger in my face.
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you wanted him to suffer, you could have just exposed the affair."
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And hurt Adda?
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Never.
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Her memory will not be sullied, not while I'm alive to protect it."
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell us how to lift the curse.
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest will watch as Temeria turns against him.
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just as he turned Adda against me.
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Unh.
470,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I, Sabrina Glevissig, offer myself to the Brotherhood"
471,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to make good on the promise  of the Spheres.
472,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To not place power before virtue.
473,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[murmuring]
474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To respect...
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thinks] Where is she?
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thinks] You didn't hear?
477,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Sabrina] ...for as long  as my flesh endures.
478,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Welcome to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. You may perform your enchantment.
479,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yenna.
480,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yenna, what are you doing?"
481,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Undoing what you've done.
482,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll have my father sign this deed declaring me his natural-born daughter
483,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and not an elven bastard.
484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you really think this slip of paper will fool the Chapter? Yenna--
485,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get your hands away from me!
486,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was a test.
487,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It was, uh, an idiotic manipulation. Forgive me."
488,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can your apology save me from Nilfgaard?
489,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take me to Aedirn?
490,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do they make me more than my blood?
491,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you think this will?
492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fine.
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell them you lied.
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Say you concocted this slander  to gain the favor of your precious rector.
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's too late. You missed initiation.
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The enchantments are done. Think clearly.
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're so smart, aren't you? You know everything."
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm sorry. I had no way of knowing how the information would be used.
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But neither did you.
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do not turn this on me.
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're pretending your precious rectoress  never ordered you to spy on me?
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Look, I-I can fix this."
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Brotherhood--they've offered me a seat on the Research Chapter. Me.
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Okay? Neither of us have to go to court.
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can't be serious?
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We can travel the continent together.
508,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We can be together. We can forge a whole new destiny.
509,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah.
510,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A life holding dustpans while you brush off forgotten bones?
511,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's not destiny.
512,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's slow suicide.
513,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't mean that.
514,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Would it frighten you to know you're  not privy to every one of my thoughts?
515,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are patronizing me.
516,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was going to Temeria for you.
517,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That was your decision.
518,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You really think I wish to waste my days  gossiping at court?
519,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That's your fetish, not mine."
520,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A true man would state his desires.
521,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, how would I recognize them? Huh?"
522,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You get off on disguising yours  as my own. Oh.
523,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stregobor was right.
524,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That's exactly why you're here, exactly what she taught you."
525,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everyone's a pawn.
526,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will not be schooled by a man
527,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who pimps the world  as some romantic adventure.
528,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My world is cruel.
529,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
530,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Unpredictable.
531,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You enter, you survive, you die."
532,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, victimhood is not your color."
533,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nor heroism yours.
534,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're just angry because  you lost your chance to be beautiful!
535,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want to be powerful.
536,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Seen and adored with everyone watching.
537,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is what I'm owed.
538,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No amount of power or beauty  will ever make you feel worthy of either.
539,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[waltz plays]
540,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Let's take a rest, dear."
541,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Foltest, leave your sister be."
542,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Show Madame de Vriess some respect.
543,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What wonderful children, Your Highness."
544,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you.
545,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Excellence.
546,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,An Aedirnian would surely have had better footing.
547,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] You claim to be  quite the artist. Prove it.
548,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Chapter would have my head.
549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do they already have your cock?
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
551,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll need time to prepare the herbs.
552,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That won't be necessary.
553,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't be foolish. You can't be awake during the procedure.
554,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can.
555,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Foltest] Oh so quick to violence.
557,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Strange, considering what Miss Merigold  told me about you."
558,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And what's that?
559,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She told me...
560,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to trust you.
561,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
562,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Will this work?
563,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Answer honestly.
564,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't know.
565,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Will my...
566,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,will my daughter...
567,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,be normal?
568,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She'll need special care.
569,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's lived as an animal.
570,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All she's ever known is...
571,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,rage and hunger.
572,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt sighs]
573,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
574,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What is this?
575,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For the princess.
576,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If I can lift the curse.
577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A gift.
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're giving me this because you do not expect to see morning.
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This isn't my first time trying to save a princess
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who others see as a monster.
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened to that princess?
582,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I killed her.
583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I did try to resist, at first, with Adda. We both did."
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"For all it brightens, love casts long shadows."
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I envy you.
586,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To live...
587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and never have to fall in love.
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
589,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[moans]
590,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witcher.
591,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is madness!
592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are we doing here? What's happening?
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How can I lift the curse?
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is not right.
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Foltest must pay for what he did.
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Explain that to her.
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Carry me out. I order you.
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me how to lift the curse.
600,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
601,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sh-She was hiding from the Brotherhood.
602,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She sold me a lamb.
603,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sh-She told me  to wait until a full moon,"
604,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to wait and then to kill it.
605,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And then I recited some silly chant.
606,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And then I bathed in the lamb's blood until sunrise.
607,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Until the rooster crowed three times. And that is all.
608,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I swear. I swear. Now please let us leave.
609,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What was the chant?
610,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping] It was years ago.
611,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was Elven. Um...
612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wh-- what is it? The-- I-- I've done what you've asked.
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What more can I do?
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Nothing, unless you can  keep a striga out of her crypt"
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,until a fucking rooster crows three times.
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're gonna have to fight her till dawn.
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave my eyes. These as well.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is a cost to all creation.
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A sacrifice that is always made.
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To be reborn...
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you will bear no more.
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you understand?
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good.
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[water dripping]
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screeching]
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screeching]
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No. No. Come back here.
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Please. Please!
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'd leave a man  bound to die in such indignity?
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're not a man.
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]

644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Please forgive me.
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was Foltest.
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was his fault.
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I loved your mother.
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[croaks]
