55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]

189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I heard your note, and, yes, you're right,"
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,maybe real adventures  would make better stories.
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And you, sir, smell chock-full of them."
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Amongst other things. I mean, what is that? Is that onion?"
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It doesn't matter. Whatever it is,  you smell of death and destiny."
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Heroics and heartbreak.
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's onion.
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Right, yeah. Yeah."

210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rectoress of Aretuza.
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sobs] You should've let me die. At least I had control over that.
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, that's adorable, piglet."
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You weren't taking control. You were losing it.
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Be in the greenhouse in 20 minutes.
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door slams]
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[winces]
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] I sense your terror.
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you are right to be afraid.
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Chaos is the most dangerous thing in this world.
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is all around us all the time.
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Volatile and powerful.
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But... each one of you
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,showed an aptitude for channeling it.
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your conduit moment  created a new ripple in chaos,"

228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,On accident.
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sabrina... turned her mother fat.
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But just because you are conduits of chaos...
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,does not mean that you are capable of magic.
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want to go home.
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is your home.
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Listen closely. Your survival depends on it.
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Magic is organizing chaos.
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And while oceans of mystery remain,"
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,we have deduced that this requires two things.
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Balance and control.
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Without them, chaos will kill you."
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is the simplest of trials
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to see whether  you are worthy of the ascension.
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Between your flower and your stone lies the balance.

250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your hand...
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is the balance.
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Demonstrated beautifully. Thank you, Fringilla."
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is no conjuring something from nothing.
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is a give and a take.

293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your cloak...
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My father made it.
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ziven Ozol. He clothes Cintra's finest.
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You look like you've been through hell.
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like all of us.
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man coughs]
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're elf ears.
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I killed them all.

316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard only got past Cintran borders because of elven spies.
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Technically, it was the elves' land first."
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Our brother died for that land.
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And your father died for Calanthe's selfishness.
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One conflict after another.
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Robbing us of our homes,  our men, and our lives."

351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are we looking for again?
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Blessed silence.
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grasshoppers chirping]
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, I don't really go in for that.  Have you ever hunted a devil before?"
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Devils don't exist.
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right.
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Obviously. Then, uh... then what are we doing?"
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sometimes there's monsters, sometimes there's money."
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rarely both.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's the life.
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[projectile hits]
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shit!
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Act Two begins!
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What was that?  Looks like a tiny cannonball from a...
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, my gosh."
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt... it is a devil.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ohh.
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I have to see this magical, this mythi--"
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[projectile hits]
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave me be!
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You talk.
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Of course I talk!
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened with you? Your mother fuck a goat?
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I am Torque the Sylvan, a rare and intelligent creature!"
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're a dick. With balls.
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Balls I got from humans,"
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who left our food filled with iron meant to poison me!
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ow!
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did your mother fuck a snowman?
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You are intelligent, I'll give you that."
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So I won't kill you, but you can't stay here."
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Neither can you.
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Look into her eyes.
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Look until a door becomes a window.
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Seek to understand your partner's greatest fears.
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With our eyes?
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, piglet. With chaos."
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Thought transference should flow through you,"
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,like learning to dance or swim or kiss.
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come on, you can do it."
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispering voices]
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...drowning...
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Anica's worst fear is snakes.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come here.
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You take weeks to lift your stone.
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can't bend water.
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You struggle to perform the simplest physical tasks.
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And now you lie to me?
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your worst fear makes such sense.
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Even if you were a beauty, still, no one would love you."
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tissaia's right.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've been here for weeks and can barely do shit.
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"See, my thought transference trial at Ban Ard took... three days."
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Boy I was paired with had a phobia of cheese.
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want to be good. Good at something.
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll get there.
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I didn't give up.
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now I can read minds.
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Great. Is that what you're doing?
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You can read me, if you like."
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
417,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't think it's working.
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can see.
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can see.
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just...
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] Just look past.
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I see them.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are they?
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Moon jellyfish.
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I... I can hear them.
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cicadas in summer.
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can taste it.
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm.
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both sigh]
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's warm bread.
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are these the things you love?
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,These are the things I thought you would love.
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So tired.
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But I can't sleep, either."
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're still scared, aren't you?"
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, you're safe now."
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've got you.
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm looking for...
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for Geralt of Rivia.
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know him?
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Afraid I don't.
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's a knight?
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't know.
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What about your mother or your father?
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My parents died when I was a baby.
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My grandmother took care of me.
450,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where is she?
451,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She, um..."
452,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,died.
453,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,In the Nilfgaard attack.
454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[mother] Oh. I'm so sorry.
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'm sorry, too."
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For your family.
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We'll get through this together.
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We take care of our own.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder crashing]
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get up.
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Welcome, Fringilla."
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Welcome, Lark."
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Welcome, Doralis."
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Welcome, Sabrina."
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And welcome back, piglet."
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder claps]
470,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tor Lara, the Tower of the Gull."
471,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The most potent place on the continent.
472,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Off-limits, except to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers."
473,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why?
474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This trial tests your ability
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to control  the ultimate expression of chaos.
477,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Catch lightning in a bottle.
478,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's impossible.
479,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, it's magic."
480,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Doralis.
481,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bottle up.
482,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now.
483,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's still breathing.
485,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder rumbles]
486,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lark, move Doralis aside."
487,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Anica, your turn next."
488,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Quickly.
489,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can do this.
490,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] Quickly.
491,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did it.
492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[squeaks]
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams]
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Piglet, your turn."
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Faster.
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams]
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia]  Sabrina, show these girls how it's done."
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] The strong amongst the weak.
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scream echoes and fades]
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder rumbles]
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder crashing]
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What you did there  was pathetic and dangerous.
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Felt pretty powerful to me.
508,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are mages like Sabrina who ignore their emotions.
509,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And then there are mages like us who are consumed by them.
510,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like us?
511,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your first night here at Aretuza, you tried to kill yourself."
512,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And tonight, you almost killed someone else."
513,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It is your job to control chaos, not become it."
514,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can.
515,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But if I send you to advise a king,"
516,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and your precious little feelings get hurt when he won't listen,"
517,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and you submit to chaos, he dies, his people turn on us."
518,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whose fault would that be?
519,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mine.
520,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
521,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mine for letting you ascend.
522,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I understand.
523,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you?
524,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You lie. You keep secrets.
525,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You succumb to emotion, to weakness."
526,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you actually have what it takes?
527,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting]
528,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
529,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
530,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
531,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
532,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is the part where we escape.
533,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is the part where they kill us.
534,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who's they?
535,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
536,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[in Elder] Beast!
537,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Elves.
538,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oi, that's my lute. Give that back."
539,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Quick, Geralt. Do your-your witchering--"
540,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shut up!
541,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
542,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
543,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[in Elder] You shut up!
544,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My Elder speech is rough. I only got part of that.
545,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Humans, shut up."
546,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[in Elder]  Ah, got it, thanks so much."
547,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you wanna die right now?
548,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As opposed to later?
549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, please, not the lu--"
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave off!
551,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's just a bard.
552,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
553,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't deserve the air you breathe.
554,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[lute jangles]
555,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Everything you touch, you destroy."
556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
557,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
558,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You hide in your golden palaces.
559,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You beat a bound man, too scared to even look him in the eye!"
560,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you like my palace? Hmm?
561,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Does it live up to the tales you humans tell?
562,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
563,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
564,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, take that, pointy."
565,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
566,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezes and coughs]
567,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Wait, what's-what's wrong with her?"
568,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's sick.
569,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, and who's this?"
570,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
571,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He's Filavandrel, King of the Elves."
572,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not a king. Not by choice.
573,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were stealing for them.
574,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I felt for them. They were forced out of Dol Blathanna.
575,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Forced out? No, they chose--"
576,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know anyone that would  choose to leave their home? To starve?
577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To have a Sylvan steal for them?
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Toruviel, no one was supposed to get hurt."
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's two humans in the ground when countless elves have died?
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One human.
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you can let him go.
582,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then Posada will learn that we've been stealing.
583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The humans will attack.
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Many will die...
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,on both sides.
586,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The lesser evil.
587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No matter what you choose,"
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you'll come out bloody and hating yourself.
589,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Trust me.
590,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's the problem.
591,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't.
592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is necessary.
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I understand.
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As long as you understand...
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that it won't be long before you follow me in death.
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, because they pushed us from viable soil."
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Even chaos is polluted.
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Synthetically enhanced so humans can make magic.
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Chaos is the same as it's always been.
600,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Humans just adapted better.
601,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You say adapt, and I say destroy."
602,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are choosing to starve.
603,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're cutting off your ear  to spite your face.
604,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You think this is about pride?
605,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My elders worked with humans and got robbed of all they had.
606,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And when they fought back, they were slaughtered."
607,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Great Cleansing,"" humans call it."""
608,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I called it digging a mass grave for everyone I loved.
609,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And now the humans  proudly watch these very fields grow...
610,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,our babies fertilizer for their grain.
611,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't wish to bury anyone else.
612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was once  Filavandrel of the Silver Towers.
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now I'm Filavandrel of the Edge of the World.
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I bring my people down from these mountains,"
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it would mean  bowing to human sovereignty.
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They'll make slaves of us.
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pariahs of half-blood children.
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then go somewhere else.
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rebuild.
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get strong again.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Show the humans that you are  more than what they fear you to be.
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Like you, Witcher?"
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have learned to live with them.
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So that I may live.
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Please, my King."
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are others. A new generation.
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Evellien who wish to fight!
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let us take back what's ours.
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Starting now.
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wait!
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Torque, stand aside!"
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Torque] The witcher could've killed me.
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But he didn't.
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's different.
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like us.
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you must kill me...
637,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am ready.
638,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the Sylvan's right.
639,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't call me human.
640,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] She knows about us.
641,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm gonna be sent home. We'll never see each other again.
642,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What do you mean, we'll never see each other again?"
643,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, no. This-This is not the last time. We-- We'll find a way."
644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How?
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,W-With one of those extra-special portals?
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, look, you know--"
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I wish I could show you, but I-I can't risk the knowledge"
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,reaching the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why?
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not the method of magic we're taught. It's older. It's more potent.
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It could open doors  that can't be closed again.
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't understand.
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My worst fear is true.
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm still not enough.
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Even for you.
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come.
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want to show you.
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sniffles]
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come.
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs and sniffles]
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know whose skulls these are?
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dead people?
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dead elves.
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,These elves built Aretuza.
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You mean as slaves?
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, no. This was before humans."
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Elves are the original sorcerers of the continent.
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When humans and monsters all arrived after the Conjunction of the Spheres...
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,elven mages taught the first humans how to turn chaos into magic.
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And then...  the humans slaughtered them...
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so they could pretend the power had always belonged to them.
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
675,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rewriting history  with the stories we tell...
676,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"the songs we sing  about our own triumphs, it's what we do."
677,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I want to honor them.
678,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Feainnewedd only grows where elder blood has spilled.
679,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Open your mouth.
680,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
681,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
682,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whooshing]
683,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
684,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How did-How did you do that  on your first try?
685,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I should go.
686,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[portal closes]
687,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,W-W-Wait-Wait.
688,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wait. Wait.
689,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
690,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispers] Wait.
691,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My father...
692,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My real father...
693,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,he was half-elf.
694,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you remember the Great Cleansing?
695,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thousands of elven lives lost.
696,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sobs]
697,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's how my father died.
698,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,His blood is... why I'm cursed with a twisted spine.
699,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why I'm only worth four marks.
700,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why no one could ever love me.
