318;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[laughter and cheering]
319;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;There was no slaying.
320;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I had my arse kicked by a ragged band of elves.
321;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[groaning]
322;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I was about to have my throat cut

326;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;Yeah, the song.
327;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;At least when Filavandrel's blade kissed my throat, I didn't shit myself.
328;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Which is all I can hope for you, good lords.
329;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;At your final breath,

334;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Eist;It would have been your blade at Filavandrel's throat
335;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Eist;had you been there, Your Majesty.
336;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[loud cheer]
337;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Eist;Not that any elven bastard would crawl from their lair to meet you on the field.
338;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Any man willing to paint himself in the shadow of his failures
339;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;will make for far more interesting conversation this night.

353;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Your grandmother slaughtered my family!
354;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;No, that's not true.
355;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;She ordered it.
356;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;After Filavandrel's uprising--
357;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Ciri;She wouldn't do that.
358;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Her soldiers...
359;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;they laughed when they did it.
360;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Killing, raping...
361;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;They laughed the hardest
362;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;when they were swinging babies from their legs,
363;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;smashing their heads in.
364;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;I was the only one left.
365;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Because I hid.
366;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;I should've saved them.
367;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Or fought and died.
368;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Ciri;Uh...
369;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Ciri;I don't know what to say.
370;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Say nothing.
371;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;They're gone now.
372;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;I would do anything to forget who I was.
373;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Ciri;I can't.
374;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Ciri;I have to find my destiny.
375;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Why? Because your grandmother said you should?
376;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Maybe you should start thinking for yourself.
377;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;Because she is dead.
378;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Dara;And you are here.

384;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Tell me, how does a witcher find himself at my daughter's wedding feast
385;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;dressed like a... [laughs]
386;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I'm protecting the bard from vengeful royal cuckolds.

388;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Idiots, the lot of them.
389;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Still, I'm glad of your company, which could prove handy.
390;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;I have no doubt blood will spill here tonight.

394;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I'm helping the idiot free of his coin.
395;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;[scoffs] And he's the idiot?

399;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;I'd do so myself,
400;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;only I'm bound to uphold an artifice of decorum and... fairness.
401;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Hey.
402;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I can't help you.
403;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;So perilously direct.
404;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;As Queen, I could command it.
405;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;If I were one of your subjects.
406;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;I could torture you so very slowly into compliance.

803;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;I thee bind.
804;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[sighs]
805;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[barks]
806;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[grunting]
807;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[growling]
808;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[gasps]
809;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[growling and moaning]
810;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[wheezes]
811;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[gasps]
812;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Pavetta;The twelfth bell has not yet rung.
813;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;What has happened?
814;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;I think your blessing of this marriage...
815;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;has fulfilled a destiny.
816;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;The curse has been lifted.
817;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Jaskier;Whew! [laughs]
818;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Jaskier;I think this has the makings of my greatest ballad yet.
819;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;If you're alive in the morning. Don't...
820;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;grope for trout in any peculiar rivers until dawn.
821;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;No, wait! Wait.
822;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;You saved my life.
823;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;I must repay you.
824;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;You've proven yourself to be the kind of man who would do the same.
825;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I want nothing.
826;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;No, please.
827;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;Please, Geralt of Rivia, do not feel like you're doing me a service.
828;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Duny;I cannot start a new life in the shadow of a life debt.
829;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Fine.
830;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I...
831;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;claim the tradition as you have,
832;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;the Law of Surprise.
833;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Give me that which you already have but do not know.
834;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;[Calanthe] No!
835;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;What have you done, Witcher?
836;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Fear not, Your Majesty,
837;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;if I am seen in your kingdom again, it'll be to kill a real monster,
838;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;not lay claim to a crop or a new pup.
839;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Destiny can go fu--
840;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Pavetta?
841;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Are you...
842;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Calanthe;Oh...
843;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Fuck.
844;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;Clearly the girl has access to immense primal power.
845;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Yeah, and with no idea how to control it.
846;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;I'm gonna stay.
847;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;Guide her.
848;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[sighs]
849;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;You're a good man, Mousesack.
850;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;You should stay too.
851;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;This has been enough partying for me.
852;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I'm getting out of here.
853;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Alone.
854;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;You're bound to this now, Geralt.
855;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;Whether you like it or not.
856;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I'm not for changing.
857;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;You know me better than that.
858;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;Yes, I do, but you can't outrun destiny just because you're terrified of it.
859;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;It's coming, Geralt.
860;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;Not believing won't change that.
861;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Bullshit.
862;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;This was just a girl using her magic to stop her mother from gutting her lover.
863;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Nothing more.
864;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;So you say.
865;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;But the bond that will come into being between you
866;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;and this child...
867;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;when it is born, will be extraordinary.
868;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;If you dismiss it, leave without claiming this...
869;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;child surprise,
870;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Mousesack;you will surely unleash true calamity upon us all.
871;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;I'll take that chance.
872;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[sighs]
873;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Mind yourself.
874;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;True words are rare birds in courts like this.
875;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Watch for daggers in your back.
876;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Or, more likely, poison.
877;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Geralt;Be careful, old friend.
878;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[sighs]
879;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;Queen Calanthe.
880;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;Mistress, I've found her!
881;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[grunts]
882;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Cahir;Is it working?
883;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Fringilla;Calanthe's progeny is in Brokilon Forest.
884;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;soldier;We can spare ten thousand men to take it, sir.
885;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;soldier;Maybe 12.
886;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Cahir;Shut up!
887;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Cahir;Armies are not the way into Brokilon Forest.
888;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Cahir;Damn it!
889;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[gasps]
890;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;Soldier;Come on, get moving!
891;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[yelps]
892;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[whispering voices]
893;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;dryad;You must drink from the source.
894;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;;[gasps]
895;1;4;Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials;dryad;What are you, child?
