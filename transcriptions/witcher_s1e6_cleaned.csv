21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or you'll what?
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sing us to death?
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps you did not hear the man.
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Yeah! Perhaps you didn't...
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Di-- Sorry, who are you?"
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Move along,"
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,old man.
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do as the bard asks or I'll be forced to draw my weapons.
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What weapons?
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I see no steel 'ere.
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm!
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cries out]
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh! [exclaims]
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Steel won't be necessary.
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier breathing heavily]
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I believe those are mine.
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier stammers]  Geralt, they--  With the--"
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This woman just killed a man with her bare hands
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for trying to steal your horse.
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Maybe she'll make a better travel companion, then."
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Uh, I'm sorry, who are you, exactly?"
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am Borch Three Jackdaws.
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"These are my companions, Téa and Véa."
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I've been looking for you, Geralt of Rivia."
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"This is a first for me, and that's saying something."
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've very few firsts left.
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But to dine with the Geralt of Rivia...
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your adventures are legend.
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're welcome.
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Est Est, small."
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I suppose you want me to tell you why I've sought out
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,such an accomplished monster hunter.
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't trouble yourself on my account.
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckling]
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] I just want food.
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I knew I'd like you.
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That was the first reason.
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One of everything you have. And keep the ale coming!
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[innkeeper] On its way!
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The second one is this.
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A short while ago,"
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a green dragon landed across the border in King Niedamir's mountains.
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know what you're thinking.
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Impossible, dragons are so rare."""""
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But it's true.
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Locals spotted it and went after it in search of treasure.
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Of course, they succeeded only in wounding the creature"
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and angering it so righteously
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that it swooped down from its lair and set half a hillside ablaze.
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch] Dead sheep everywhere.
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You have the most incredible neck.
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's like a... a sexy goose.
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ugh.
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gu-- guzzling.
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Borch] Now, the King is in a bind."
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He's set to marry the princess of his rival kingdom, Malleore,"
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which means it's bad timing
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to have a murderous pest lurking about in the mountains.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's commissioned a hunt to kill it.
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Four teams have signed on.
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The winner gets the dragon treasure hoard
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,plus the title of lord over one of his new vassal states.
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That is... if he survives.
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What does this have to do with me?
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want you to join my team.
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier] I can hear it now,"
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a tale of two Zerrikanians
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and their valiant poet lover.
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh! [chuckles] We're so doing this. We're in.
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You've wasted your breath, Borch."
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't kill dragons.
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Take my advice.
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No treasure is worth dying for.
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Depends on the treasure.
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What I need is...
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a new adventure.
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One final first before I'm too old to do anything but die.
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You think killing a dragon will bring you that?
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"All I know is there's one path up the mountain,"
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and it's overrun with monsters.
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With you on my team, dear Witcher, we'll be unstoppable."
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men laughing]
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Someone get me a fuckin' drink!
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Barman!
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Those dwarfs will be part of the hunt.
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Barman.
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt could handle them in his sleep.
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fuckin' right!
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He said he wants four fuckin' pints!
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now.
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or maybe a little bit awake.
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Téa] Then there are the Reavers.
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Have you heard of them, Witcher?"
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And the answer is no.
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You feel it just the same as me...
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that hole inside you.
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That itch that can't be scratched that burns your brain,"
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,keeps you awake at night.
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come with me.
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll show you what you're missing.
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What am I missing?
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sorry to interrupt this lovely moment... That's only three.
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where's the-- What's the fourth team?
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Hm.
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Them.
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh! [laughs]
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ooh-hoo-hoo! Oh, no, no, no."
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Thank you so much. It's been very nice."
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Thank you for the wine and the pies,"
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but as the man said, we really can't get involved."
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Geralt, shall we?"
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm in.
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mother of...
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The hunt begins at sunrise.
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your man might've mentioned that the road was too narrow for horses
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in his initial sales pitch.
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Welcome to the world, Jaskier."
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Damn it to Korath!
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's got your goat?
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Someone's stolen my pack.
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Probably those fuckin' Reavers!
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Aye, well..."
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,three days' journey and only one route to the top.
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leaves plenty of time for me to piss in his gruel! [cackles]
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aah.
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Name's Yarpen Zigrin.
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt of Rivia.
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And my name is Julian Alfred Pankratz--
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aye. I know.
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll fetch a goodly amount for that mare if you sell now!
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Charming how everyone wants to get their hands on Roach these days, isn't it?"
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He means we won't make it out alive.
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Wait, what? No one mentioned anything about impending death!"
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How is it that I've walked this earth for decades
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"without coming across a witcher,"
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and then the first one I meet, I can't get rid of?"
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier] I'd say something strange was afoot,"
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but then again, witchers are bound to bump into monsters eventually."
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Jaskier.
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Yennefer.
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The crow's feet are new.
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, well, your jokes are..."
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,old.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[nickers]
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Thanks, Roach."
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What are you doing here, Yen?"
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] I'm here with my escort.
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Noble Sir Eyck of Denesle.
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To assist him in killing the dragon.
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For kingdom and glory!
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Till we meet again, Geralt."
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"See you, Roach."
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bugle blowing]
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bugle blowing continues]
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Ciri] Who is Geralt, exactly?"
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did my grandmother know him well?
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did she never mention him to me before... that night?
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Protecting you has always been our primary purpose.
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why'd she let him claim the Law of Surprise?
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's that even mean?
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When one has saved another from certain death,"
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the Law of Surprise can be claimed
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to pay that debt.
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri] Who did Geralt save?
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] Your father.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Duny. In payment, he bound you to Geralt."
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's your destiny.
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then why hasn't he found me yet?
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Questions, questions."
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll be together soon.
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Exactly as your grandmother wished.
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Make haste, children."
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] It is so kind of you to share the spoils of this expedition
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,with an old man such as Borch.
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're like two fiercely loyal...
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"uh, friends."
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I wanna say friends. Relatives.
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Contract security.
208,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To hunt with him is an honor unsullied by payment.
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But why? [chuckles]
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He is the most beautiful.
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You worry if you blink, you'll never see her again."
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're in love with her.
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or...
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the danger here isn't the dragon.
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Borch] That's why I brought you along, Geralt of Rivia."
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothing scares you.
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Huh.
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then you don't know Yennefer of Vengerberg.
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch laughs]
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"May she be the worst encounter, then."
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Melitele preserve us.
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened here?
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Dragons avoid people.
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It should have left when they attacked.
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't get it. Why the retaliation?
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When your species is on the verge of collapse,"
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,perhaps everything becomes more desperate.
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier] Yeah, I mean, you can use twigs,"
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"uh, but I-- I mean, I personally prefer..."
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"using flowers, you know?"
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Roses.
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Daffodils.
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[hissing]
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Flora and, yikes, fauna."
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A cactus, if she's really into it."
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ladies, you look famished."
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Allow me to wander aimlessly into this thicket
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and retrieve for you, uh..."
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a tasty afternoon treat.
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh... uh...
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right. Hm.
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am hungry. Anyone else hungry?
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I could genuinely eat a...
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Okay.
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[animal barks]
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's something back here.
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It sort of looks like a faun.
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Jaskier...
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Hello.
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Hello, little fellow."
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[animal whimpering]
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aw! Aren't you just the cutest...
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[animal growls]
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[stammers] Most...
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,terrifying thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Right, run away! Run away! Geralt!"
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[animal growling]
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's one of your... friends again.
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exclaims]
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low growl]
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What in the name of Bloemenmagde is that?
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] It's an hirikka.
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's probably starving. Sheathe your weapons.
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[roars]
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpers]
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[hirikka cries]
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Eyck grunting]
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[slashing and thumping]
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[continues yelling]
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For kingdom and glory!
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sir Eyck!
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] Yeah...
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You could have been killed!
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If we'd fed it, it would've gone away."
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thanks.
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That knight may be a fuckin' dumbbell,"
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but I'll be damned, the dragon won't stand a chance."
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Borch] Um...  I'm not sure I'd eat that, good sir."
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Knights never waste a kill.
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughs]
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's precisely why I'll make a great lord to Niedamir's vassal state.
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A great knight must lead by example.
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For--
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kingdom and glory.
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We know.
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My subjects will be the luckiest serfs in all the lands.
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Especially with the beautiful Yennefer as my mage.
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I cannot wait to serve you, My Lord."
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How would you like to serve me tonight...
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witch?
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Careful, Boholt."
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, the Witcher wants to play knight too, hmm?"
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's plenty able of murdering you herself.
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Boholt laughs]
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What's so amusin', you overgrown cock hair?"
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm just wondering who I will kill first.
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The monster,"
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or the monster hunter.
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Eyck's stomach gurgles]
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, dear."
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Um... I'm afraid I must take my leave.
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lady Yennefer, may I escort you to your tent?"
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Will you be joining me?
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Uh... My Lady, I would..."
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[stomach gurgling]
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...never degrade your honor in such a way.
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[snorts] I hate to break it to you, but that ship has sailed,"
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,wrecked and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ow.
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[farting]
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh...
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[straining] I need a shit.
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Eyck whimpers]
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yarpen] So, shall we tell the poor bastard"
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that he's vying for a vassal state that won't exist in a decade?
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,States rise and fall like the tide.
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothing new.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is fuckin' new!
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The rightful son of Nilfgaard has returned, burnin' through the south."
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With Fringilla as his mage.
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs] Nilfgaard's a joke.
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saw it with my own eyes down in Ebbing.
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Those zealot freaks are inching closer by the day.
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Won't be long till they try and take Sodden.
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Next it'll be Temeria.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Redania.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cintra.
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Queen Calanthe would die before letting them take what's hers.
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps if Nilfgaard's religious zeal had been tempered earlier
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,by a stronger hand...
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you'll excuse me,"
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I must get my beauty sleep.
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I don't think it'll make me prettier,"
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but I need sleep too.
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So... we're all about to have new evil overlords,"
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and dragons are, in fact, a thing."
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good day all round.
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, you've all seen a dragon before, have you?"
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Geralt, will you please tell them?"
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Their numbers are dwindling.
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Treasure seekers saw to that. But they do exist.
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What people call green dragons,"""""
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"like the one we have here,"
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they're the most common.
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Red dragons, less so."
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Black dragons are the rarest.
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gold dragons are rarest.
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gold dragons are a myth.
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"For a gold dragon to exist,"
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it would... have to be the result of...
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"an accidental, unique mutation."
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And in my experience,"
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"mutations, they're intentional."
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But it doesn't matter.
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mutant or myth,"
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,gold dragons met the same fate as anything too different to endure.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They died out.
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are other ways of enduring.
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If it's legacy you're after,"
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,perhaps you should take the overgrown cock hair's advice and become a knight.
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sir Witcher...
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the White-Haired...
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of Rivia.
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckling]
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You'd make a rather shitty one, refusing to slay dragons."
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But probably not as shitty a one as Sir Eyck of Denesle!
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Keep walking. The Nilfgaardians could be anywhere.
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're not safe yet.
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Dara] How did you escape the attack, Mousesack?"
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Ciri] Dara, please."
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Dara] Ciri says you vanished into thin air.
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did you abandon your Princess?
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We were...
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I was pulled through a portal by Nilfgaard,"
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,kidnapped and held prisoner for days.
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And how did you escape them?
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He sent me to get Ciri.
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Witcher?
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Trained to fight and bound to Ciri.
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And he rescued you so you could then rescue her?
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Alone?
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ask him yourself.
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's in a town
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,just past this thicket of trees.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must find him.
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To safety.
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[quietly] Something's off about this, Ciri."
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The waters there were--
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, they've worn off,"
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which means I'm thinking straight.
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know what happens to people who escape a siege?
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because they don't just vanish.
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They get captured and they get turned.
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Remember what the Dryad Queen said.
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ask the right questions."""
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's not just your life, Ciri.  It's mine too."
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[clinking]
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Mousesack] Princess, I forgot."
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I brought this for you.
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My grandmother's sash.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[birds chirping]
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Has anyone seen my escort?
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen] Ah! Bloody ball sacks!
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who slits a man's throat while he's relieving his bowels?
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is nothing sacred anymore?
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ugh.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fuck!
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Véa] We're halfway to the dragon's lair, but it's getting dangerous."
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We cannot continue like this.
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen] The warrior woman is right.
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Someone killed that self-righteous fud,"
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and it wasn't any of us.
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Somebody's not playin' fair.
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Our people used to mine these mountains.
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We know a shortcut that will cut half a day off our journey.
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let the Reavers take the long way around.
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We'll nab the treasure before they even set foot in the cave.
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We'll watch each other's backs until we reach the next peak,"
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then every man for himself.
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What say ye?
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let's go.
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aah!
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go on. I'll catch up.
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you kill Eyck?
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kill him?
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's rather pedestrian.
450,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you're the one who's been  staring daggers at him since we arrived.
451,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was the Reavers.
452,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That bastard Boholt killed my escort
453,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,before he could accomplish the one damn task I actually needed him for.
454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And what was that?
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yen!
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are you really doing here?
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm here for the dragon.
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are certain healing properties it's rumored to possess.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I thought your transformation
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,healed all parts of you?
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"At the cost of losing others, yes."
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer...
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,do not tell me you've traveled all this way
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for made-up fertility cures using fresh dragon hearts?
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're not made up!
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They are.
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And seriously?
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You, a mother?"
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you think I'd make a bad one?
470,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Definitely.
471,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yen...
472,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A child? What could you possibly want with a child?
473,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They took my choice. I want it back.
474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not that I'd expect you to understand.
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I didn't choose to become a witcher.
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] Listen...
477,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"the people who made us,"
478,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they made us sterile for a lot of reasons.
479,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One of the kinder ones
480,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is because this lifestyle isn't suited to a child.
481,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
482,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were going to summon chaos on kings' orders
483,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in between feeding and naps?
484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do not patronize me!
485,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not.
486,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've thought about this. Often.
487,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I'd rather use my Child Surprise as bruxa bait
488,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,than subject it to this life!
489,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What did you just say?
490,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
491,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ah, fuck!"
492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You have a Child Surprise?
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Isn't that rich?
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You lecture me on made-up cures for having a child,"
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,meanwhile you cheat with destiny to steal one.
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Every time I'm near you,"
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I say more in five minutes than I've said in weeks.
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I always regret it.
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The dwarfs,"
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they're leading us to a shorter path.
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come along.
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can take care of myself.
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't always have to.
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come with me.
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's waiting for us.
508,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you ever stop missing Skellige?
509,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
510,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's just that I don't think I'll ever stop missing Cintra, but..."
511,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"you left your home to come raise me, how did you feel about that?"
512,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was...
513,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,very homesick.
514,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Remember when we'd visit?
515,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ice skating with Crach an Craite?
516,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He always said he let me win, but I was just faster."
517,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you miss the cold too?
518,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, very much."
519,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Except you have arthritis!
520,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
521,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You hate the cold!
522,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you always said Skellige was where you came from
523,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but Cintra was your home, with us!"
524,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hey!
525,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've had enough of you.
526,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mousesack, stop!"
527,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Our name is not Mousesack!
528,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We killed Mousesack
529,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and took his disgusting form...
530,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
531,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...to find you.
532,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
533,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
534,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sizzling]
535,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Doppler yells]
536,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
537,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We prefer it like this anyway.
538,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
539,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
540,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
541,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
542,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarls]
543,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
544,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where are you taking us? Who wants her?
545,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The man with the winged helmet.
546,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why is he going to so much trouble?
547,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'm special. I don't know how or why, but there's something inside me."
548,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kill him!
549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then I'll do it!
551,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Wait, no, no, no, no, no!"
552,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarling]
553,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
554,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yarpen] Mind the scree fallin', hear me?"
555,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can get a bit rocky round here if it's windy.
556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Which...
557,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it is.
558,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
559,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're here.
560,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, you're right, this is a shortcut... to death."
561,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You wanna beat those Reavers or not?
562,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We should turn back.
563,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
564,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're very close.
565,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How can you possibly know that?
566,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,'Tis a perfectly fine route.
567,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For a dwarf.
568,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aah!
569,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stifle your mewlin'. You'll manage.
570,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As long as you don't look down.
571,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
572,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
573,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
574,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen] See ya on the other side!
575,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier] Yeah, yeah, yes."
576,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen shouts]
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Uh, ladies first?"
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah! All right. Yep.
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come on, Jask. You've got this."
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've got this.
582,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen] Come on!
583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer grunts]
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen] Careful!
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, whoa!"
586,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, fuck! Oh..."
587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, that is not a good sign."
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That is not a good sign.
589,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yarpen shouts]
590,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wood creaking]
591,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Phew!
592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[creaking]
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Véa screams]
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch groans]
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Okay...
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[strains]
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt!
600,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get back!
601,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sir Witcher, you will save us yet."
602,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But first, you must let go."
603,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
604,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[creaking]
605,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
606,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer gasps]
607,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt! The planks won't hold!
608,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
609,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you.
610,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts] No!
611,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] You did your best.
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's nothing else you could have done.
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Look, why don't we leave tomorrow?"
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That is, if you'll give me another chance to prove myself a..."
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,worthy travel companion.
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Hm.
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We could head to the coast.
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get away for a while.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sounds like something Borch would say, doesn't it?"
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Life is too short.
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do what pleases you...
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,while you can.
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Composing your next song?
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Jaskier] No, I'm just, uh..."
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just trying to work out what pleases me.
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So simple.
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do  you like it?
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is this not what you came for?
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I came for you.
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I was afraid that mountain would take you from me,"
637,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but now I fear it took your senses instead.
638,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Only my nonsense.
639,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I quite like your nonsense.
640,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighing] Hm...
641,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That scent.
642,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The moment I dread most every time you leave...
643,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is when it fades.
644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When you're really gone.
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You left first.
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,In Rinde.
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I woke up in that destroyed house and you were gone.
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Forgive me.
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you hurt?
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't mean physical pain.
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They say witchers can't feel human emotion.
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They say whatever justifies despising our kind.
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Huh.
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you regret it?
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Becoming a witcher?
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's hard to regret something you didn't choose.
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But if the choice had been yours,"
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,what would you have done instead?
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A farmer?
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A stableman?
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both chuckle]
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Horses are good company.
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But if I ever dreamed of being something...
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,other... than what I am...
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it was too long ago to remember.
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you dream of being a mage?
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I didn't have much of a choice either.
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you always want to become a mother?
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I dreamed...
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of becoming important to someone.
675,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Someday.
676,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
677,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do I bore you?
678,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles] Not at all.
679,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
680,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Before we met,"
681,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the days were calm...
682,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and the nights were restless.
683,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But now... [sighs]
684,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you're important to me.
685,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good morning.
686,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
687,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird calling]
688,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
689,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"At a quick pace, we can make it back to the Pensive Dragon before sundown."
690,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are you talking about? We're almost at the top.
691,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I came here for a reason, Geralt."
692,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not leaving till I've killed that dragon.
693,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yen, no!"
694,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What will it solve?
695,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It will solve everything.
696,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wait.
697,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where are those fucking dwarfs?
698,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yen!
699,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelps]
700,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpers]
701,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing shakily]
702,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't scream.
703,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I understand why you're afraid.
704,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If there had been any other way to extract you, I'd have done it."
705,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It was never my intention to torment you, Princess."
706,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All I want...
707,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,all I've ever wanted is to help you fulfill your destiny.
708,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The White Flame has brought us together.
709,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You are the key to everything, Cirilla."
710,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You must be starving.
711,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll get you something to eat.
712,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crackling]
713,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
714,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What have you done?
715,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You lied to us.
716,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You didn't tell us what she is.
717,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What she's capable of.
718,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You fucking fool!
719,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
720,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting] Uh-uh!
721,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We know all your tricks.
722,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
723,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
724,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you really believe all this nonsense in your head?
725,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This prophecy?
726,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
727,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We think you're insane!
728,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
729,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
730,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
731,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
732,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crunching]
733,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are an abomination!
734,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will destroy you!
735,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both grunting]
736,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
737,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams]
738,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
739,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're still here, aren't you?"
740,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scree tumbling]
741,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer speaks Elder]
742,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
743,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[shuddering]
744,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
745,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No closer!
746,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What the fuck?
747,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get back!
748,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should've stayed dead.
749,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Stop!
750,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How?
751,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's dead.
752,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's dead.
753,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[roaring]
754,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[roars]
755,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch] Sir Witcher and his sorceress.
756,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low growl]
757,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hello again.
758,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Impossible.
759,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Téa] When the dragoness was injured,"
760,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth.
761,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the egg could not be moved
762,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or the life inside it would die.
763,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's why the dragon attacked.
764,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[heart beating]
765,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She was protecting her baby.
766,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Téa] And then we heard about the King's hunt,"
767,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,realized we had to keep our enemies close.
768,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So I came to find you,"
769,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"the white-haired witcher,"
770,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the knight who was taught to save dragons instead of kill them.
771,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[growling]
772,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Looks like we get to fuck up the whole family.
773,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Slay that dragon!
774,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt yells]
775,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kill them!
776,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Boholt's mine!
777,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Aard, now!"
778,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
779,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low growl]
780,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch] I'm afraid we have more.
781,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go! I'll protect the egg.
782,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get them!
783,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer yells]
784,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
785,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer yells]
786,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So I get to kill you after all, Witcher."
787,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
788,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[roaring]
789,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not going to happen!
790,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shame you don't get to see me crack that egg!
791,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
792,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both panting]
793,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
794,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
795,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sniffs]
796,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt?
797,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dwarfs?
798,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, gosh. Phew!"
799,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah! What'd I miss?
800,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Huh?
801,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Guys?
802,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
803,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are we... queuing for something?
804,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's going on?
805,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
806,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, no!"
807,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, fuck!"
808,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened?
809,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, gosh!"
810,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh! Bloody hell.
811,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What the fuck are you doing here?
812,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, that's fuckin' shite! We missed a whole mother lode of fun."
813,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ask no questions, and in return, I offer you these to take to the King."
814,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dragon teeth?
815,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I've never been one to look a gift cock in the beak,"
816,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,though this might not be enough proof to collect the reward.
817,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tell the King if he's not satisfied,"
818,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,he can expect the body of a dragon dropped upon his royal wedding.
819,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Free of charge.
820,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
821,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aah!
822,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
823,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[twigs snapping]
824,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[footsteps approaching]
825,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpers]
826,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[muffled cries]
827,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He caught me. He's going to come back,  Dara. We have to hurry."
828,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Dara curses in Elder]
829,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If we had just stayed in Brokilon, Ciri, we'd be safe right now!"
830,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How could I have known?
831,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because we agreed to it. Hmm?
832,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I stay with you any longer, I'll be dead too."
833,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you say you're so special.
834,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What you really mean is that you're just like Calanthe!
835,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You bring terror and you bring death wherever you are!
836,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm doing the best that I can.
837,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm done apologizing. I'm done with all of this.
838,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have to move on.
839,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're right, Princess."
840,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Find a new family,"
841,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,because I can't be there for you anymore.
842,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is my final first.
843,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A child.
844,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"This treasure, this legacy"
845,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,must endure.
846,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is no other reason to go on.
847,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you for protecting it.
848,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And thank you, Yennefer of Vengerberg."
849,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can see why Geralt didn't want to lose you.
850,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What does that mean?
851,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,In Rinde.
852,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn.
853,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's why we can't escape each other.
854,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why I feel this way inside.
855,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
856,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] It's not because of anything real...
857,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or true.
858,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You made a wish.
859,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's magic.
860,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's real, Yen."
861,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How could we ever know?
862,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Disregard for other's freedom has become quite your trademark.
863,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I made that wish to save your life.
864,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I didn't need your help!
865,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like fuck you didn't!
866,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And you, you flit about like a tornado,"
867,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"wreaking havoc, and for what?"
868,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So you can have a baby?
869,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A child is no way to boost your fragile ego, Yen."
870,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll take advice from you about children as soon as you take responsibility
871,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for the one you bound to you and then abandoned!
872,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch] That's enough.
873,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm going to save you both a lot of hurt with a little pain now.
874,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The sorceress will never regain her womb.
875,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And though you didn't want to lose her, Geralt,"
876,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you will.
877,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He already has.
878,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You wanted to show me what I was missing...
879,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,there she goes.
880,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What you're missing is still out there.
881,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your legacy.
882,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your destiny. I know it.
883,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you know it.
884,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Phew! What a day! [chuckles]
885,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I imagine you're probably--
886,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Damn it, Jaskier!"
887,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Why is it whenever I find myself  in a pile of shit these days,"
888,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"it's you, shoveling it?"
889,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, that's not fair."
890,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Child Surprise, the djinn,"
891,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,all of it!
892,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If life could give me one blessing,"
893,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it would be to take you off my hands.
894,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right. Uh...
895,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Right, then."
896,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll...
897,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll go get the rest of the story from the others.
898,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"See you around, Geralt."
899,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Cahir winces]
900,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla]  They're combing the area.
901,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They haven't found him,"
902,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or the girl.
903,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A simple test of silver would've sufficed.
904,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had steel at the ready.
905,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We can pull in more soldiers. Keep searching.
906,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We won't stop.
907,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We cannot mistake the stars reflecting  in a pond for those in the night sky.
908,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Spare me the lecture, Fringilla."
909,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You rose up against the Usurper.
910,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Helped free our people from their chains.
911,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I witnessed the White Flame call on you...
912,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,mold you...
913,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,anoint you.
914,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It burns in you, Cahir."
915,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She is the key,"
916,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but you...
917,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you are the commissioner.
918,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do not despair.
919,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will find her.
920,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And we will spread his supremacy all through the kingdoms,"
921,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,whether they deserve it...
922,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or not.
923,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gather the men.
924,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We cannot fail him.
925,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The time of the sword and the ax is nigh.
