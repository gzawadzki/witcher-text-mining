1,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cawing]
2,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[caws]
3,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Love surprises.
4,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Love visitors.
5,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A surprise visitor all the more.
6,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've had eyes on you for a while.
7,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
8,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're very flattered.
9,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But who is this secret peeper
10,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,peeping all our secrets?
11,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know who you are.
12,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What you are.
13,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're different to other dopplers.
14,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're not good-natured or helpful, are you?"
15,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And yet you are here for our help.
16,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you not have errand boys where you come from?
17,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They lacked your valuable set of skills.
18,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't worry.
19,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[raven cawing]
20,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not silver.
21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We fancy our freedom.
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It is not money we thirst for, per se."
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is plenty that you do thirst for.
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Assassination on behalf of the Kingdom of Nilfgaard.
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or perhaps another eye or ear to round out your artful composition.
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We'd planned on wearing this one for a while.
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But we are flexible.
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[neighing]
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse nickers]
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting]
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A cell of dimeritium made just for you.
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How does it feel to be neutered of your powers?
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I know how you were schooled,"
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,how you were shaped.
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This isn't who you are.
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The White Flame made me who I am...
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,gave me a higher purpose.
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You could've had that too,"
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,if only you realized that Cintra had to fall.
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have found his purpose.
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This one?
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do we have to?
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Run.
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Black Knight] I said run!
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing heavily]
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Everything you've ever done,"
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"ever debated,"
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"ever dreamed,"
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is in our head now.
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Even this morning,"
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,when you thought to take your life.
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He didn't want to be abused.
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[doppler] Incorrect.
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He didn't want to be used.  [chuckles]
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can't change the world this way.
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Only one of us will be alive to find out.
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah.
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't know what you're doing.
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't know what she is.
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She will end up where she belongs.
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cracking]
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack whimpers]
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Would've made a terrible noose.
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're to bring me the girl alive.
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So many rules.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fine.
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But it'll cost you.
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Children are our favorite.
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're a wee bit shy.
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've never been shy a day in my life.
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Count it again.
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Times are shifting, my dear."
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My rates have gone up since last we spoke.
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've found more demand for my services.
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then your customers will be awfully disappointed
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,when they find a charred spot where you once stood.
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,None more so than yourself.
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've come so far already.
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just a few more...
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,treatments should do the trick.
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Isn't it lovely,"
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the life we've chosen?
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not being bound by the rules of the Brotherhood.
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Living off the grid with no resources.
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mm. It's a dream come true.
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loud thud]
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lucky for you, you found your way to an intolerant kingdom."
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"For quick coin, head to the nearest town in any direction."
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your skills will be rewarded.
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If it's as you say, then why aren't you out there taking advantage?"
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As you're so inclined.
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Hemet chuckles]
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because my customers...
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,come to me.
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Hemet]  I see a lot of myself in you.
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Follow my footsteps.
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You could gain some repute.
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Find a whole new career to fund what you...
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so desperately want.
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With mages like us,"
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,word of mouth is paramount.
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"There is no us."" There's only me."""
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I know a thing or two about stirring word of mouth.
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chatter]
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] I'd given up altogether.
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Love, that's nice, but not on the cards for me."
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not in my lifetime.
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It took me nearly a whole one to find him.
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman moans softly]
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As you can see, passion is not the trouble."
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Our issue...
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,my... issue is of a mechanical nature.
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Hm.
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have just the thing.
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Now, be prepared."
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The spell should take effect quickly,"
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and will endure until your lady utters a handpicked magic word.
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Anything come to mind?
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kumquat?
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You arrived at that rather quickly.
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kumquat it is.
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chanting]
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughs]
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We'd better go now, schnucki."
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door closes]
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What is this...
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,wretched business here?
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you not understand the sign?
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you familiar with who I am?
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coins clink]
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, won't you end this rather melodramatic suspense and tell me?"
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He is Beau Berrant.
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps you are not aware  of the rules here?
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you are casting spells,"
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I need to collect what's due to the kingdom.
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm afraid those terms seem rather shite to me.
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did suspect you possessed such a predilection.
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Though I am less...
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,burly than your usual type.
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Dryad General, in Elder] We can't trust her."
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She hid her identity, her past,"
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,her ties to Cintra...
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shan-Kayan is the only reason we know who she is.
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ciri was scared.
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps she can't yet trust us.
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We still don't know her intent.
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's a girl...
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who possesses the power of a weapon.
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"In Brokilon, she can be molded."
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She can become one of us.
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's not one of us.
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaardian spies.
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Found them searching our border.
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Their whole army will arrive. It's only a matter of time.
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if this girl...
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is our only way...
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to survive?
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rustling]
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ciri...
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[in English] ...will be allowed to stay.
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exhales deeply]
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't think they like me.
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When Queen Calanthe closed the borders of Cintra,"
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it was to protect her people.
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The General wants to protect us.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We all make decisions.
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The sword of destiny has two edges.
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What does that mean?
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You must make the choice.
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can stay. Or you can continue on your search.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What do you want to do?
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] ♪ 'Cause you all know That this bard ♪
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ Loved ladies from Nilfgaard ♪
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ 'Cause Nilfgaard can kiss my... ♪
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt!
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hello.
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What's it been, months? Years? What is time, anyway?"
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I heard you were in town.
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Are you following me, you scamp?"
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, I'm flattered and everything,"
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but you should really think about getting a hobby one of these days.
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ugh!
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you want some?
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"How are you doing?"" I hear you ask."
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, the Countess de Stael,"
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"my muse and beauty of this world,"
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,has left me.
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Again. Rather coldly and unexpectedly, I might add."
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I fear I shall die a brokenhearted man.
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Or a hungry one, at the very least,"
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,unless somebody fancies sharing a fish with an old friend?
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, are we not using friend""?"""
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, sure.  Let's just give it another decade."
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Geralt, you're fantastic at a great many things,"
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but clearly, fishing is not one of them."
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you caught anything today?
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What are you fishing for, exactly?"
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is it cod?
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Carp?
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pike?
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bream?
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm just-- I'm just listing fish that I know.
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Zander? Is that a fish?
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not fishing.
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't sleep.
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right. Good.
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, that-- that makes sense."
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Insomuch that it sort of...
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,doesn't.
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What's going on, Geralt? Talk to me."
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A djinn.
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] A what?
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] I'm looking for a djinn.
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For a dj-- For a djinn?  A dj-- Like a genie?
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs] The floaty fellas with the... the bad tempers
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and the banned magics, that kind of genie?"
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes. It'll grant me wishes.
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's in this lake somewhere.
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I can't fucking sleep!
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I don't mean to play priest's ear or anything,"
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but has it occurred to you that maybe we're merely rubbing salve on a tumor?
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not exactly addressing the root cause of the problem?
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm?
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, maybe, just-- just maybe,"
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,this whole sleeplessness-ness
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,has got something to do with what  the druid Mousesack said to you in Cintra?
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, the Law of Surprise?"
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny?
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Being unable to escape the child that belongs to you, et cetera, et cetera?"
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No! It's not that.
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, you're probably right."
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But what if you're not?
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, the Countess de Stael once said to me"
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that destiny is just the embodiment of the soul's desire to grow.
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you sing to her before she left?
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I did, actually, and she..."
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Why, what are you implying?"
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh... [laughs]
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We are so having this conversation. Come on, Geralt. Tell me. Be honest."
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How's my singing?
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[water splashes]
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling.
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[stutters in shock]
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You need a nap!
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, are you trying to hurt my feelings, Geralt? It's..."
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's down-- downright indecorous of you, if I'm completely honest, and--"
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[stammers] Wow. Wow.  What is-- what is that?
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a wizard's seal.
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn.
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Do you mind if I--
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Jaskier.
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take it back about my fillingless pie.
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Take it back, you get your djinny-djinn-djinn."
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let go.
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No! No, let go, you horse's arse!"
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's a bit of an anticlimax.
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breeze stirring]
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or is it?
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind rising]
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Djinn, I have freed thee, and as of this day, I am thy lord."
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Firstly, may Valdo Marx, the troubadour of Cidaris,"
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,be struck down with apoplexy and die.
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Secondly, the Countess de Stael must welcome me back with glee,"
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,open arms and very little clothing.
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thirdly--
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Jaskier!
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wha--
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stop!
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are only three wishes.
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, come on, you always say you want nothing from life."
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How was I to know you wanted three wishes all to yourself?
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I just want some damn peace!
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, here's your peace!"
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[amphora smashes]
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[growls]
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt groans]
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[choking]
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughs and gasps]
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt...
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt... it's the djinn!
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screeching and growling]
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezes]
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughs]
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezing]
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Jaskier.
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[coughing]
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is there a doctor here?
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, yes. Chireadan, the elf healer."
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Over there.
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezing]
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A djinn in a bottle?  It's like a fairy tale.
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Without the happy ending. Can you help him?
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezing]
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping for breath]
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, dear."
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I assure you I have received the best medical education
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"right here in Rinde, but..."
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,these injuries are of a magical nature.
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I can help with the pain, but it's a bit like..."
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Putting salve on a tumor?
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No!
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,His throat was attacked.
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If the spell's action isn't halted as soon as possible,"
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that damage might be irreversible.
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans] Wha--
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Chireadan] And the longer he goes untreated,"
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the more likely it is to spread.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He could die.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fuck! Geralt.
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, we won't let that happen."
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The medicine should buy him a few hours, but he needs a magical remedy."
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll have to take him to another town.
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There isn't a mage here?
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The mayor says they are dangerous.
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What aren't you saying?
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezing]
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me.
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Well...
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,there...
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,there is one mage.
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I...
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,was tasked with bringing this mage to justice.
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I was unable to penetrate certain defenses.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The mayor himself has made the catch and has imprisoned the mage in his house.
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That wasn't so fucking hard, was it?"
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans in pain]
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Chireadan] Be careful.
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The mage is powerful and malicious.
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And quite cunning.
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll go find him.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping and coughing]
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] You like pain.
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We get it.
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I inflict pain.
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"My dear, you still think there's a difference."
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's been too long.
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I haven't seen you for years.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not since you maneuvered your way onto Aedirn's court.
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mm.
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I heard that went well.
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"King Virfuril is fine, I'm sure."
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's dead now.
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,King Demavend reigns now.
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Down south, Fringilla's thrived in the post that should've been yours."
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The rightful heir returned to Nilfgaard and she's helped him restore peace.
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why are you here?
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia] You remained hidden for a while,"
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but now,"
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you're making noise.
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're looking for something.
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're wasting your time.
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The so-called mages you're enlisting will not help you with your problem.
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And if you're not careful, you will become just like them... irrelevant."
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are pure chaos right now.
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You want a cure, and it's making you sloppy."
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Brotherhood left you to your own devices
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,once you abandoned Aedirn.
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But this behavior,"
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"flaunted in direct conflict with their agenda,"
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,will not be tolerated.
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They will come after you.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] That's why you're here.
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To warn me.
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How can I ever repay you?
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't be petty.
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is on you.
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You knew the cost of enchantment.
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I didn't know what it would mean to me.
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What does it mean to you?
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why?
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why do you want a baby?
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Continent is vast.
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just because you don't know of a cure doesn't mean there isn't one.
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's simply beyond your scope.
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is time to move on.
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Return to Aretuza.
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, thank you."
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Aretuza might be everything to you, but I'd rather forget it."
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Aretuza is everything to the Continent,"
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to world order.
417,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am here
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to offer you a chance for redemption.
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Aedirn, all of this nonsense, will be forgiven and forgotten."
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You can use your talents to shape a new generation.
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Am I hearing this right?
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The great Tissaia wants my help?
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's the matter?
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you lost your touch?
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Only you can be thrown a lifeline and think that you are saving me.
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're afraid I'll be everything you could never be...
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,without you.
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Which is the rub.
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You only want me to do well so long as you had your hand in it.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How did we get this way?
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I gave you all I could give.
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What more do you want?
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everything.
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You may go, Rectoress."
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have business to attend to.
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighing]
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whoa!
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighs]
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guard] A fee for entrance.
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezes]
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A fee to see the mayor? This is urgent.
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I don't make the rules,"
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but money opens all doors.
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse nickers]
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Hm.
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thuds]
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So it does.
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezing]
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
450,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whoa!
451,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[clattering]
452,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whoa.
453,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier wheezes]
454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[jug shatters]
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Welcome...
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to my home.
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're the Mayor of Rinde?
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not exactly what I was expecting.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,May-- May-- [whimpers]
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sorry, he's in a bad way."
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is there a mage that lives here?
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah. The apple juice!
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She wants some.
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And she always gets...
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,what she wants.
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't understand. Does he want me to get him the apple juice?
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathlessly] I don't know.
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whimpering]
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt grunts]
470,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mayor Rinde snoring]
471,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Oh...
472,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good.
473,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The fuck?
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier gasps]
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt sighs] Hm.
477,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[slow, seductive music playing]"
478,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
479,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stay.
480,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezes]
481,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I, uh..."
482,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,brought you apple juice.
483,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And quite a bit more.
484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're immune.
485,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You must be the mage.
486,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer of Vengerberg.
487,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Hm.
488,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Chireadan didn't mention that, uh..."
489,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What did he fail to mention?
490,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We need your help.
491,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We""?"""
492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezes]
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Just a friend, I hope?"
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your heartbeat, it's extraordinarily slow."
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're...
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a mutant.
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A witcher.
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt of Rivia.
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The famous White Wolf!
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I thought you'd have fangs or horns or something.
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had them filed down.
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,First time I've seen a witcher up close.
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What little spells can you cast with your hands?
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Call it professional curiosity.
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Please,"
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Jaskier here needs immediate attention.
508,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And then, if you'd like,"
509,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll indulge your curiosity all night long.
510,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It won't take all night.
511,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I'm sure we can find a way to fill the time.
512,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He was attacked by a djinn.
513,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A djinn?
514,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Whatever's wrong with him,"
515,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it's spreading.
516,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fix it,"
517,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and I'll pay you.
518,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whatever the price.
519,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
520,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You'll have to do better than juice.
521,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ragamuffin!
522,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[music stops]
523,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all gasping and murmuring]
524,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thuds]
525,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's in a deep healing sleep.
526,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How long will he sleep for?
527,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Long enough for you to bathe.
528,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How did you...
529,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, right."
530,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Magic.
531,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I hardly think bathing in this house is going to leave me any cleaner.
532,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I insist.
533,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I can not only guess the age and breed of your horse,"
534,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but also its color...
535,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,by the smell.
536,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
537,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer's footsteps receding]
538,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Fishing for a djinn seems an extreme measure
539,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to remedy sleeplessness.
540,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When extreme measures seem reasonable,"
541,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"yes,"
542,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm desperate.
543,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
544,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And yet you didn't ask me to help with that.
545,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Looming death kind of jumped the queue.
546,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now I'm wondering if I can afford you.
547,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have I accidentally agreed to indentured servitude?
548,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer inhales]
549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Geralt] Go ahead,"
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,ask about them.
551,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everyone does.
552,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everyone else is boring.
553,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Turn around.
554,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
555,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's cheating.
556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Nobody smart plays fair.
557,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tell me,"
558,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,are all witchers similarly blessed?
559,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come now,"
560,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you promised.
561,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
562,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I haven't conducted a survey,"
563,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but I'd hardly say we're blessed.
564,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, don't be so grim."
565,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were created by magic.
566,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Our magic.
567,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you. Made for a magical childhood.
568,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Happy childhoods make for dull company.
569,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Judging by your wrists and your wits,"
570,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,your childhood was very happy.
571,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But Aretuza fixed you up nicely.
572,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What was your ailment before?
573,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Clubbed foot?
574,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Split ends?
575,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tell me, are there women who find this coarseness charming?"
576,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe some place where they find your coin very charming indeed.
577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm. You seem to find coin pretty charming yourself.
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Clearly capitalizing on the political situation here.
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm serving the stifled people of this town.
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Filling a need.
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ever heard of it?
582,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's fine to fly in the face of overzealous authority,"
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but to pretend it's anything other than making a profit...
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And to pretend you're after a djinn to cure insomnia?
586,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hmm...
587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[inhales] Fortunately for you,"
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"once I've paid for your kind services,"
589,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it'll be none of your concern.
590,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fortunately for you,"
591,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've determined your company and conversation payment enough.
592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's the matter?
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Water not suit?
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is a little tight.
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I believe I sized you up quite right.
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt sighs]
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you doubt my capabilities?
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] No.
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just your intentions.
600,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I said some things to him.
601,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's a...
602,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A friend?
603,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'd like it not to be the last thing he remembers.
604,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He won't remember much if he's dead.
605,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
606,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a joke.
607,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He will survive.
608,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And recover his vocal talents.
609,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Does that satisfy you?
610,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not in the slightest.
611,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But don't reproach yourself for it, Yennefer."
612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not easily satisfied.
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[faint indistinct whispering]
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispering grows louder]
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's the sign from the seal.
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll be taking Jaskier now.
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you wake him before he's healed,"
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the spell won't take.
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That's no way to treat a friend,"
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You want the djinn,"
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but the amphora's broken.
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn's already long gone.
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do go on.
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me how stuff works.
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn is tied to this plane and its master.
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How many wishes did the bard express before he lost his voice?
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You need Jaskier to make his last wish so you can capture it.
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So that's...
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,two... then.
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn will fight you.
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you try and bend it--
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[soft sighing sound]
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[clears throat]
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[inhales]
637,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah...
638,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That scent...
639,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[soft sighing sound]
640,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Lilac and...
641,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gooseberries.
642,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exhales sharply]
643,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tough to get in your head.
644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You have a strong will,"
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but you can't contend with me.
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sorry I couldn't be direct, I knew you'd fight it."
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I do love a good old-fashioned trap.
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A good old-fashioned...
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,nap.
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Chireadan echoing] Wake up.
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wake up!
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Chireadan.
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,At long last.
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chain jingles]
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where are we?
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,At the spa.  Where do you think we are?
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I hope your rampage was well worth it.
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Rampage""?"""
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What did I do?
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where to begin?
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You...
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"attacked a pawnbroker in his shop,"
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,kicking him in the delicate places.
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Hm.
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You also dragged the apothecary into the street,"
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,pulled down his pants and thrashed his arse with a belt.
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Both are on the town council,"
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who are voting to usurp the mayor and kick Yennefer out.
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Any of this ring a bell?
675,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like a faded dream.
676,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She had you enact revenge on her behalf.
677,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I tried to stop you,"
678,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but the guards assumed I was there to abet.
679,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt sighs]
680,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The sentence will be passed by the very council members you attacked.
681,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It is sure to be death.
682,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I suppose that's one way of getting some rest.
683,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why on earth would you enlist the mage's help after my warning?
684,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's like you thought the scorpion  were prettier than a spider
685,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,because of its lovely tail.
686,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You weren't exactly forthcoming.
687,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I admit I could've better prepared you for Yennefer.
688,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're under her spell, aren't you?"
689,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I wish I was, but no."
690,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a simple issue of body chemistry.
691,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're in love with her?
692,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I think perhaps you may understand me.
693,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[door opens]
694,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I thought it would take longer to build the scaffold.
695,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
696,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ah, fuck."
697,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Here you are.
698,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Remember me?
699,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did not know you were a witcher.
700,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've always wanted to play with one.
701,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[heart beating slowly]
702,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
703,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezes]
704,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
705,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh! Where am I?
706,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whew! Um...
707,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right. Good.
708,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Good. Um...
709,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not to be...
710,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,untoward or anything... [chuckles]
711,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but... [stutters] ...did we...
712,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you know...
713,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[stutters] ...do the, uh..."
714,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ooh, Go-- Oh, no! No!"
715,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Definitely did not butter that biscuit.
716,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Look, I am so sorry,"
717,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but I've just remembered I left my... cat
718,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,on the...
719,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,stove.
720,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I-- I really must be going.
721,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Express your deepest desires and you can be on your way.
722,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, my deepest desires are currently satisfied, thank you so much."
723,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
724,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How's your throat?
725,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] Uh...
726,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps you should try some scales.
727,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
728,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,♪ Toss a coin to your witcher ♪
729,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"♪ O, Valley of... penis ♪"
730,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, God."
731,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you want to keep all you have...
732,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier whimpers]
733,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...make a damn wish.
734,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
735,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
736,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathes deeply]
737,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[guard] What's the difference between a witcher and a tub of dung?
738,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt grunts]
739,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
740,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ah, I know that one. [chuckles]"
741,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
742,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What is repulsive,"
743,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,deviant...
744,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt grunts]
745,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...and cannot smell?
746,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A witcher without a nose.
747,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt groans]
748,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Last words, Witcher."
749,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Make them good.
750,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I want you to burst, you son of a whore."
751,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
752,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering fades]
753,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are the one with the wishes.
754,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[faint indistinct whispering]
755,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts and whimpers]
756,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Make your wish!
757,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do it now!
758,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't-- I don't know! I...
759,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I wish very badly to leave this place forever.
760,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
761,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chanting in Elder]
762,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
763,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer continues chanting]
764,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[djinn roaring]
765,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
766,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer continues chanting in Elder]
767,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, Geralt. Thank the gods. I might live to see another day."
768,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We need to go.
769,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Jaskier, you're okay."
770,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm glad to hear that you give a monkey's about it.
771,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let's not jump to conclusions.
772,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened?
773,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, I was having a rather lovely dream which then turned into a nightmare."
774,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There were naked women in both parts.
775,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The first one was loving, tender, very generous."
776,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The second, significantly more terrifying."
777,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me about the second one.
778,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, black hair, devilish eyes, was painting an amphora on her abdomen."
779,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, the usual."
780,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She wants to be the vessel.
781,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What, you know this woman? Of course you know this woman."
782,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She wants to become more powerful.
783,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But she'll die.
784,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, let's pray for her on our way out of town."
785,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh...
786,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you perhaps short of a marble?
787,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You have to go in there, don't you?"
788,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I recognize the look. I know how you feel.
789,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're making me uncomfortable.
790,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Do not tell me that this is finally the moment"
791,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you've decided to actually care about someone other than yourself?
792,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave the very sexy but insane witch to her inevitable demise!
793,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She saved your life, Jaskier. I can't let her die."
794,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
795,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer speaking Elder]
796,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
797,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't!
798,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm here to help you.
799,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
800,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't need your help.
801,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're free.
802,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No longer under my spell.
803,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Geralt] And yet,"
804,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,here I am.
805,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You seem to want to meet your end.
806,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As do you.
807,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
808,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cracking]
809,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The djinn isn't weakening.
810,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The bard expressed his last wish,"
811,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but it's... [screams]
812,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cracking]
813,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] It's getting stronger!
814,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go!
815,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's because I'm the one with the wishes.
816,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[djinn muttering faintly]
817,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You?
818,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps] You're the djinn's master?
819,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[djinn growling]
820,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah.
821,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, what are you waiting for? [screams]"
822,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cracking]
823,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Make your wishes!
824,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Becoming the vessel for the djinn will have you lose control,"
825,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,not gain it!
826,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
827,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can't you see what this is doing to you?
828,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,True transformation is painful.
829,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Release the djinn!
830,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll give you my last wish!
831,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You heroic protector...
832,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cracking]
833,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"...noble dog,"
834,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,permitting my success so long as you command it yourself.
835,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams] Fuck off!
836,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll do this myself!
837,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crunching]
838,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Damn it, Yennefer! Tell me what you want!"
839,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want everything! [screams]
840,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
841,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
842,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[thunder rumbling]
843,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rubble falling]
844,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sir, what's going on in that house?"
845,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My house. And...
846,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have no idea!
847,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[in distorted voice] Make your wish! You can have anything you want!
848,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You could choose not to be a witcher.
849,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What do you desire?
850,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Immortality?
851,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Riches?
852,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fame?
853,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Power?
854,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screams]
855,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
856,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispers] I wish...
857,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispers indistinctly]
858,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer panting]
859,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[house creaking]
860,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer gasps] The djinn...
861,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
862,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Wh--
863,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where did it go?
864,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[creaking]
865,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
866,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Chireadan] Are you sure they were up there?
867,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This can't be happening.
868,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This can't be happening.
869,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She could not have survived it.
870,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did Geralt go in there? It doesn't make any sense.
871,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What, to save a mad fucking witch? Why?"
872,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because she was magnificent.
873,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer screams]
874,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt panting]
875,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer?
876,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer.
877,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's me...  Geralt.
878,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
879,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know who you are.
880,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[shakily] What did you do?
881,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You stopped me, didn't you?"
882,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I nearly had it.
883,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] You had shit all.
884,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saved your life!
885,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] And I saved yours!
886,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You let the djinn escape.
887,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who knows what havoc it'll wreak now that it has no vessel at all?
888,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] No more havoc than you.
889,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Djinns are only dark creatures when held captive.
890,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How can you be so sure?
891,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When did you last feel happy when you felt trapped?
892,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And if you were going to portal us to safety,"
893,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you could've taken us out of this shit town!
894,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A fine critique if you could make a portal yourself.
895,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It wasn't a shit town,  it was fine till you came along."
896,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had a plan!
897,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles] And that was going swimmingly!
898,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was.
899,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like a drowning fish.
900,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing heavily]
901,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer gasps]
902,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What am I supposed to do now, hm?"
903,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It wasn't supposed to go this way.
904,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm gonna write you...
905,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the best song...
906,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"so that everyone remembers who you were,"
907,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"what we did,"
908,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,everything we saw.
909,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I will sing it...
910,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for the rest of my days.
911,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He always said I had the most wonderful singing voice.
912,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're alive.
913,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bollocks.
914,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt?
915,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
916,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, they're alive."
917,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're really alive! Whoo!
918,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, he..."
919,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come on.
920,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Whoa, hang on!"
921,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both panting]
922,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was right about you.
923,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You do know something of pleasure.
924,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fleeting,"
925,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but highly effective, I'll admit."
926,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was right about you too.
927,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Which part?
928,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There was a number of things. Which part?
929,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Doesn't matter.
930,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My plan worked.
931,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There was no plan.
932,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were making it up as you went along.
933,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Any fool could see.
934,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What did you wish for?
935,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me.
936,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt?
937,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rustling]
938,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct whispering]
939,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Dryad echoing] Weapons, weapons..."
940,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rustling]
941,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird call]
942,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[in Elder] Someone's coming.
943,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[arrow strikes]
944,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[doppler, in English] Stop, please!"
945,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've come for the girl.
946,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You try.
947,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Eithne, in Elder] Who enters our forest?"
948,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Dryad General, in Elder]  He claims he knows the child."
949,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mousesack!
950,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] Your Highness.
951,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Ciri] What are you doing, silly?"
952,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Dara, this is Mousesack. He's known me since I was born. He's like..."
953,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like family.
954,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri] What happened to you?
955,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where did you go on that street?
956,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What matters is I've found my way back to you.
957,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've come to take you to your rightful place.
958,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ciri has chosen to stay with us.
959,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It was her grandmother's dying wish
960,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that she should go to Geralt of Rivia.
961,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I know where to find him.
962,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's been promised to him through the Law of Surprise.
963,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You've been so kind to me,"
964,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but Mousesack is all I have left of home.
965,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack chuckles]
966,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri] Maybe...
967,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,he's the other edge of my destiny.
968,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you can come with us.
969,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you sure about leaving?
970,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I need answers.
971,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I need you.
972,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're my family too now, remember?"
973,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The burden of power...
974,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,can be painful.
975,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Be vigilant.
976,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Always ask the right questions.
977,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your destiny is...
978,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in your own hands and no one else's.
979,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Farewell,"
980,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,special one.
981,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri] Thank you.
982,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For everything.
983,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bye.
