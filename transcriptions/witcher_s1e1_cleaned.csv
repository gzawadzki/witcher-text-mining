11,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
12,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Today isn't your day, is it?"
13,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What will it be?
14,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Point me to the alderman's house.
15,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's down the alley to the left.
16,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We don't want your kind here, Witcher."
17,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The alderman, tell me where he is and I'll be on my way."
18,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't give the orders around here...
19,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs] you mutant son of a bitch.
20,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[innkeeper] Hear that?
21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low rumble]
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Go on your own or at the end of a rope, your choice."
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not a hard choice.
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, fuck that. Kill him with your bare hands if you have to."
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"C'mon, Witcher. You're not scared of us, are ya? Show us what you've got."
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can you not leave it alone for a moment?
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witchers can't be trusted.
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] I'm not speaking to you.
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I apologize for my man's interference in your day. Hopefully he can improve his behavior by tomorrow's market.
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sorry, Renfri. Come on, lads."
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Beer for my friend here and one for me. I am speaking to you now, good sir."
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Want some breakfast?
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm full. Venison.
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"My mother, God rest her, would be mortified."
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Our secret, then."
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, what brings you to Blaviken, White Hair? You came for a monster?"
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was traveling by the swamp.
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That would be your mistake, then. Why wouldn't you travel by main roads?"
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's hard to make a living on main roads.
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you desperately need money for new clothes.
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Two more beers.
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"More and more, I find monsters wherever I go."
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"How much coin for your kikimora, then?"
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I killed a rat this morning with my breakfast fork.
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stabbed it in its fat little gut.
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"My mother nearly fainted, but what was I supposed to do?"
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It had been shitting in our pantry for days.
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Witcher] You mentioned coin.
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girl] Yes.
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Isadora said you were looking for my father.
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She's a gossip, you see."
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Probably went two steps into the Lord's Inn
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,before she was running off telling everyone an evil witcher had arrived.
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse snorts]
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't scare me.
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's too bad.
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I can also tell you that my father will have no usefor this beast.
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your father, the alderman?"
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He posted a flyer.
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For a graveir.
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,kikimoras are useful. Population control.
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You should speak to Master Irion, our wizard."
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He's willing to pay for odds and ends he needs for elixirs.
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I sold him our dog when it died. Mysteriously.
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fine.
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take me to him.
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I got 15 crowns for the yappy mutt.
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's enough to buy some new clothes. Just saying.
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come on, Roach."
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[girl] Have you ever killed a succubus? A striga? Werewolf? She-wolf?
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's not a thing.
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So you've killed the rest?
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I think that makes you a hero. My mother says ou're the offspring of foul sorcery, a diabolic creation, a filthy degenerate born of Hell."
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you ever been to Hell?
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've never even left Blaviken.
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Because my mother's never left Blaviken,"
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and if it's good enough for Libushe, then it's good enough for Marilka."
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's my name.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[goat bleats]
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Marilka.
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like milk.
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's your name?
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt.
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Like garroter?
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nice.
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Where are you from, Geralt?"
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Rivia.
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I don't know where that is, but I could learn, if you'd let me."
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because I'm a girl and girls can't be witchers.
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Which I think is probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want more.
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I have to be more,"
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"because I don't know what to do in Blaviken for the rest of my life,"
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,except go to the boring old market.
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And kill rats.
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And dogs.
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Here we are.
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hold Roach.
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whinnies]
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Be nice.
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Marilka] Hey, Roach."
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chiming sound]
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[low, resonating hum]"
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird calling]
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Greetings.
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am Stregobor.
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Master Stregobor.
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sorcerer.
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have a kikimora for Master Irion.
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, well, forgive the confusion."
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Irion created this tower, but he's been dead 200 years."
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, in order to honor him, I've taken his name as my..."
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,personal sobriquet.
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"He create this illusion, too?"
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, this is, uh... this is..."
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,my own creation.
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Helps pass time more delightfully.
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Because you're in hiding, Stregobor."
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How very clever of you...
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Witcher.
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not often do we see your likeness here in Blaviken.
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not many of my likeness left.
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'd offer you my condolences, but..."
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I seem to remember that witchers don't feel...
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,anything.
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm grateful destiny brought you to me.
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Marilka brought me to you.
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, Marilka. Marilka works for me."
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now and then.
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,On matters of great import.
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A reclusive sorcerer who uses an alias
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and hires a young girl to procure him a witcher.
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't want my monster.
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You want me to kill yours.
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Very clever.
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Indeed.
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What kind?
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The worst kind.
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The human kind.
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Its name is Renfri.
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Damn it.
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Go on, Martin."
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ah! Five.
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah!
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not yet.
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's no way you can get five.
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're not taking a bite of that bread before I try.
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[distant clatter of hooves]
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Better throw those knuckles.
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Go on, then."
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[hoofbeats approaching]
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Told ya.
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I didn't steal the bread. Korin did!
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Quick! Quick!
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Hey, shut up, you twat!"
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You need to come with us.
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[woman] As your Queen, I grant you this commendation,"
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which will symbolize your duty and bond as liegemen
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in fealty to the crown of Cintra.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Could use with a bit of feel-ty myself right now.
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gross.
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Queen] Do you promise to defend to your utmost the weak, the orphaned..."
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Late wee pups don't get to bark.
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was playing in the square.
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...speak only the truth...
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Knucklebones?
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...loyal and brave...
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Did you win this time? Like I showed you.
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...at any cost...
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I would have,"
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,if the horsemen of doom hadn't ridden up like that.
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I grant you this...
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you can't win a game of knucklebones
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for fear of a few horses...
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...duty and bond...
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...what'll you do when you go into battle?
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,...in fealty to the crown of Cintra.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]  At least you didn't shit your kecks.
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As members of the Royal Family,"
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is it too much to ask that you exercise a modicum of respect?
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Especially you.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This is your duty as king and grandfather.
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[King sighs]
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Grant me leave, my Queen. I am worn from my trip to the Isles."
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And my bedchamber duties before that.
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gross.
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As your Queen,"
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I grant you this commendation,"
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which will symbolize your duty and bond...
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Stregobor] Destiny has many faces, Witcher."
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mine, for example, is beautiful on the outside, but..."
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,hideous on the inside.
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She has stretched her bloody talons towards me.
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wizards are all the same.
208,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You talk nonsense while making wise and meaningful faces.
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Speak normally.
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Have you ever heard of the...
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Curse of the Black Sun?
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First full eclipse in 1,200 years."
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It marked the imminent return of Lilit,"
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,demon goddess of the night sent to exterminate the human race.
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"According to the wise mage Eltibald,"
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lilit's path was to be prepared by 60 women wearing gold crowns
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who'd fill the river valleys with blood.
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Doesn't rhyme.
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All good predictions rhyme.
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I studied the girls born around the Black Sun,"
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and I found horrendous internal mutations among them.
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I tried to cure them,"
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"locked them in towers for safekeeping,"
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but the girls always died.
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Internal mutations?
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They were autopsied, of course, to confirm my suspicions."
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But eliminating these women was the lesser evil.
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They could've drowned entire kingdoms in blood.
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you'd been alive during Falka's Rebellion, seen what I saw--"
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Innocent women are dead.
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But not Renfri, the beautiful one."
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's after you.
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Daughter of King Fredefalk of Creyden.
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I delivered the princess myself in the middle of the afternoon
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in pitch black.
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Under the Black Sun, so... she's cursed."
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Do you consider me a fool, Witcher?"
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you think I did not conduct research? Renfri was acutely affected.
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Her stepmother, Aridea, told me she tortured a canary,"
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"strangled two puppies,"
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,even gouged out her maid's eye with a comb.
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I admit what happened next was not ideal, but..."
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"with the lives of Aridea's own children on the line, we had to act."
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So I dispatched someone to follow Renfri into the woods.
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We found him in the brush,"
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Renfri's antique brooch jammed into his ear.
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"After that, I organized a manhunt to find the princess, but... eh..."
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,she was gone.
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Two years.
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Until she reappeared,"
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,robbing and murdering merchants on the roads of Mahakam.
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Impaled them on sticks at first, but soon,"
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,she picked up sword skills.
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And now no man can defy her, it's said."
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're not a man. You're a magician.
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's resistant to magic.
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's impossible in humans.
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not...
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,mutated ones.
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"She's chased me for years, bent on revenge."
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And now she's tracked me here, just as you arrived."
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny.
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kill her.
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll pay you anything.
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I kill monsters.
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The kikimora kills because it's hungry, Renfri kills for pleasure."
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She is a monster. She is the last of Lilit's women.
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And she possesses the power to destroy us all.
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't believe anyone has that power.
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With the fate of the Continent at stake, is that a chance you're willing to take?"
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's your rhyme.
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Killing Renfri is...
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the lesser evil.
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Evil is evil, Stregobor."
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lesser, greater,"
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,middling...
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it's all the same.
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not judging you.
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I haven't only done good in my life either.
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But now,"
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"if I have to choose between one evil and another,"
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then I prefer not to choose at all.
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[folk music playing]
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,These shindigs need a touch of the old abracadabra.
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"At your service, Your Majesty."
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tricks and illusions to delight.
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He means to pull a disappearing act. don't you?
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saw the Wraiths of Mörhogg over the channel this morning.
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, you mentioned."
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who?
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No good will come of it.
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're an omen of war.
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The North has been at war since Nilfgaard took Ebbing.
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If legend is true, the Wild Hunt's years behind the curve."
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Nilfgaardian force crossed the Amell Pass.
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Headed to Sodden, if they're smart."
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And if not, 50 of your Skelligen ships are on the way."
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have more knights. We are prepared in case--
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Prepared for what?
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothing for you to be concerned about.
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your dismissive tone says it is.
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We're talking of war, girl."
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With Nilfgaard?
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why?
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Eist!
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Should we fall to Nilfgaard, your granddaughter will rule."
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She needs to understand the way of things.
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We will not fall, because we are not under attack!"
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's a child.
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You won your first battle in Hochebuz when you were my age.
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've heard the ballad.
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pretty ballads hide bastard truths.
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's a catchy song.
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Three thousand of my men died.
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If we must do this now,"
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,here is your first lesson.
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As in life, it is impossible always to be fully prepared for battle."
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Keep your sword close...
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and keep moving.
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[song ends]
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesty... Your Majesty.
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you for allowing our company at this splendid affair.
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesties. Your Highness.
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Would you honor me with a dance?
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh... Martin--
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She'd love to.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Reminds me of your daughter's betrothal feast.
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The night you finally saw sense, said yes."
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Made me the happiest man on the Continent.
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I did it to save my kingdom.
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And, no,"
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you may not leave this shindig.
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[whispers] Your Majesty, my scouts have returned."
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaard is on its way to Cintra.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Queen] I stand corrected.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're here.
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're already here.
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So much for being smart.
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should tell the girl.
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Queen] Let her enjoy this night in peace.
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It may be her last for a while.
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Roach neighing]
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[birdsong]
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[twigs cracking]
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The girl this morning,"
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"she took you to see Stregobor, didn't she?"
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I know who you are, Renfri."
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know that I want to kill Stregobor, then."
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I used to be a princess. Did he tell you that?
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Until he sent a thug into the woods to kill me.
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You killed him.
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With my mother's brooch.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stregobor's man raped me...
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,robbed me and let me go.
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No more princess.
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had to survive.
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I stole rather than starve.
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I killed rather than be killed.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nohorn and the others saved me.
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And they'll be by my side at the market as I get my revenge.
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Lilit help me, I will take down anyone in my way."
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Unless...
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,destiny intervenes.
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You want me to kill Stregobor for you.
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's the lesser evil.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So I keep getting told.
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stregobor asked you to kill me too.
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,'Cause I was a girl born during an eclipse?
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I could've become so many things.
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Queen Calanthe of Cintra,"
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,she just won her first battle at Hochebuz.
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But here I am trying to convince you I'm not--
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A monster.
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you?
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How am I to know?
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When I cut my finger, I bleed. That's human, right?"
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When I overeat, my stomach aches."
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When I'm happy, I laugh."
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"When I'm upset, I swear. And when I hate someone..."
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"for stealing my whole life from me, I kill him."
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,People call you a monster too.
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A mutant.
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What if they come after you?
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Attack you?
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They have.
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why not kill them?
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because then...
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am what they say I am.
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I tell you, Witcher,"
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"that I can neither forgive Stregobor nor renounce my revenge,"
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is that it?
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I admit I'm a monster?
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or...
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you can leave Blaviken...
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and finally live.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You choose, Princess."
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Roach snorts]

418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Calanthe] Charge!
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not fair that I'm trapped here.
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I could magically put you to sleep, Princess."
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just an idea.
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's been two days.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,For you and everyone else in the castle.
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The King and Queen ordered us to remain here,"
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and that's what we shall do.
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And why are you not there?
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Wherever they are.
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My duty is to protect you.
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're resentful of that burden.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's the greatest honor of my life.
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs] You are both incredibly boring.
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
433,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Many, many years ago,"
434,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,sorcerers were known to lock little girls in towers.
435,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm beginning to understand why.
436,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know cautionary tales don't work on me.
437,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The girls were said to be cursed.
438,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They were said to announce the end of the human race.
439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ooh.
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So they were systematically killed.
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The end.
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man sighs]
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Will my grandmother be all right?
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You will be all right, Princess."
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You are her blood.
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And the apple never falls far from the tree.

455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No one's coming!
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Then we fight alone. We cannot surrender Cintra!

474,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Martin] Are we going to be okay?
475,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[woman] Don't worry, Martin. The Queen will defeat Nilfgaard."
476,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will go home soon.

484,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My sweet child.

492,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The citizens...
493,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,how many of them are safe within our walls?
494,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A hundred or so, Your Majesty. The guests from the banquet."
495,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The supplies...
496,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,check we have enough.
497,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aye.
498,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You've been brave, my child,"
499,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,while I've been gone?
500,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I haven't. Ask Mousesack. I've been impatient.
501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You will rule this land someday.
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know that, don't you?"
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing heavily]
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why are you saying all this?
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you dying?

549,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But they were spectacular.
550,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I turned to that girl afterwards.

556,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah.
