35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The White Wolf!
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And he stood in the middle of that frozen lake
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,like he knew it was coming for him.
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The ice cracked open
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and a selkiemore shot out!
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, you've never seen one,"
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but it'd take down a ship with its cavernous mouth

43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And it... swallowed...

47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, this is brilliant!"
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, sorry. It's just Geralt's usually so stingy with the details."

50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He died.
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all gasp]

78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"By rights, I should be claiming ten percent of all your coin,"
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but instead,  what I'm asking for is a teeny,"
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,teeny-weeny little favor.

94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How hard could it be?
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not your friend.
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh. Oh, really?"
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, you usually just let strangers rub chamomile onto your lovely bottom?"

111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ooh, on second thoughts..."
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,might want to lay off the Cintran ale.
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A clear head would be best.
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will not suffer tonight sober
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,just because you hid your sausage in the wrong royal pantry.
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not killing anyone. Not over the petty squabbles of men.
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, yes, yes."
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You never get involved. Except you actually do,"
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,all of the time.
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ugh. Is this what happens when you get old?
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You get unbearably crochety and cantankerous?
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Actually, I've always wanted to know, do witchers ever retire?"
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yeah. When they slow and get killed.
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come on, you must want something for yourself"
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,once all this... monster hunting nonsense is over with.
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want nothing.
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, who knows?"
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe someone out there will want you.
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I need no one.
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And the last thing I want is someone needing me.
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And yet...
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,here we are.
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Where the fuck are my clothes, Jaskier?"
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ah. Well, uh, they were sort of covered in selkiemore guts,"
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so I sent them away to be washed.
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Anyway, you're not going tonight as a witcher."
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[lively folk music playing]
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Right, so stick close to me, look mean and pretend you're a mute."

146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughs]
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've missed your sour complexion.
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I feared this would be a dull affair,"
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"but now the White Wolf is here, perhaps all is not lost."
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why are you dressed like a sad silk trader?
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Jaskier] What? 
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Walk with me.
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To Mousesack!
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[all cheering] Yeah!

158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've been advising the Skelligen crown for years.
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"A tad rough around the edges, but they're of the earth. Like me."
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Castellan Haxo.
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Old and crusty.
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How long before this horse trading is done?
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I find royalty best taken in...
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,small doses.
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I wouldn't count on leaving before dawn.
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,These suitors will vie all night for Princess Pavetta's hand.
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Marrying into this monarchy is a mighty prize.
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who wouldn't want to be king of the most powerful force in the land?
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[band strikes up]
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, which one of these little shits is your coin on?"
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come with me, there's much for you to see."
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[cheering]
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Mousesack] It's not a fair bet.
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"That red-headed scanderlout over there, Crach an Craite, will marry Pavetta."
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"The Lioness has already arranged it with the boy's uncle,"

183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All an act.
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Queen Calanthe refused his proposal three times after King Roegner died,"
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,despite the two of them gliding around each other

187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, no, no."
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She was not for living in her husband's shadow again.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs]
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Something about you reminds me
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of a scoundrel I once saw fleeing my wife's chambers!
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Um, well..."
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Drop your trousers.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I didn't get a proper look at the little shit's face,"
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but that pimply arse I'd remember anywhere.
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well... uh, uh... Ah, Geralt."
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles nervously]
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Forgive me, my lord."
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This... happens all the time.
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's true, he has the face of a cad and a coward."
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mm.
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But, truth be known,"
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,he was kicked in the balls by an ox as a child.

211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First of all, you hog all the fanfare,"
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then you go and ruin my courtly reputation.
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saved your life. You're on your own from here on.
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Try not to get any daggers in your back before dawn.

238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're the daughter of the Lioness, behave like it!"
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Perhaps I should have some starving serfs brought in to slaughter, then."
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or I could decapitate some elves
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and have their heads hung about as a lesson to those who would defy me.
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will not have your hysteria turn this night upside down.
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Besides, that boorish lout is the key"

251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Where were you headed, Fiona, to end up so lost?"
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was running...
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,from the war.
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You...
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,really don't remember how you came to be in Brokilon Forest?
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yet you heard it call to you.
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There were many forests like it...
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,before the Conjunction of the Spheres.
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We adapted, fought off the mutants and men who sought our end."
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now only we remain.
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dryads.
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man yelling and groaning]
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dara!

270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sobs]
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]

273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Dryad] The waters of Brokilon are potent.
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All newcomers to the forest must drink the waters.
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If they bear ill intent towards Brokilon,"
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they die.
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If they're pure in heart, they survive..."
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and may stay here.
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And over time, the waters of Brokilon"
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,will lessen the suffering  they have endured
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and make them forget.
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I think you'd like that. Am I right...
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fiona?
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Because you're scared of more than just war,"
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,aren't you?
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You will both drink the waters,"
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and all will be revealed.
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[growling] You lie, you little shite!"
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You've never faced so much as a bad meal in your life,"
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,never mind a manticore.
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] I've had manticores thrice as fat and ugly as you perish under my steel!
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man 1] Under your bullshit, more like."
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"How many stings has it got, then?"
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Two.
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hah! Go away and shite!
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's five. I know.
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Your Majesty, that's Geralt of Rivia."
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've actually killed one.
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You--
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crowd yelling]
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Enough!
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have a renowned guest here tonight.
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps he can declare which esteemed lord is telling the truth.
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Neither.
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Are you calling me a liar, old man?"
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aah!
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Butcher of Blaviken bleats utter nonsense.
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps the lords encountered...
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,rare subspecies of manticore.
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[murmuring]
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aye.
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughing]
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Perhaps our esteemed guest would like to entertain us
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,with how he slayed the elves at the edge of the world?
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter and cheering]
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There was no slaying.
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I had my arse kicked by a ragged band of elves.
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groaning]
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was about to have my throat cut
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,when Filavandrel let me go.
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[jeering]
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the song!
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, the song."
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"At least when Filavandrel's blade kissed my throat, I didn't shit myself."
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Which is all I can hope for you, good lords."
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"At your final breath,"
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a shitless death.
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Not going to shit meself...
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I doubt it.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter]
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It would have been your blade at Filavandrel's throat
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"had you been there, Your Majesty."
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loud cheer]
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not that any elven bastard would crawl from their lair to meet you on the field.
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Any man willing to paint himself in the shadow of his failures
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,will make for far more interesting conversation this night.
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come, Witcher."
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take a seat by my side while I change.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm.
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Dryads conversing]
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did she call you Fiona?
345,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mousesack, he... helped raise me and..."
346,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,he warned me not to let anyone know who I was outside the castle.
347,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And now, the Black Knight is after me."
348,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Castle?
349,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm Princess Cirilla...
350,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of Cintra.
351,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
352,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's the matter?
353,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your grandmother slaughtered my family!
354,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, that's not true."
355,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She ordered it.
356,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,After Filavandrel's uprising--
357,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She wouldn't do that.
358,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Her soldiers...
359,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they laughed when they did it.
360,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Killing, raping..."
361,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They laughed the hardest
362,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"when they were swinging babies from their legs,"
363,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,smashing their heads in.
364,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was the only one left.
365,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because I hid.
366,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I should've saved them.
367,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or fought and died.
368,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Uh...
369,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I don't know what to say.
370,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Say nothing.
371,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're gone now.
372,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I would do anything to forget who I was.
373,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't.
374,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have to find my destiny.
375,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why? Because your grandmother said you should?
376,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe you should start thinking for yourself.
377,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because she is dead.
378,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you are here.
379,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[band playing]
380,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Damn this cursed thing.
381,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'd as soon see this night out in armor.
382,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As would I.
383,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Indeed.
384,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tell me, how does a witcher find himself at my daughter's wedding feast"
385,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,dressed like a... [laughs]
386,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm protecting the bard from vengeful royal cuckolds.
387,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hm!
388,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Idiots, the lot of them."
389,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Still, I'm glad of your company, which could prove handy."
390,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have no doubt blood will spill here tonight.
391,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Ah, save the good Queen's breath."
392,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not for hire as a bodyguard.
393,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were hired just so by the bard.
394,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm helping the idiot free of his coin.
395,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[scoffs] And he's the idiot?
396,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'm simply saying, surely if all goes to hell here tonight,"
397,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can count on you to strategically remove certain irritants
398,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that may present themselves?
399,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'd do so myself,"
400,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,only I'm bound to uphold an artifice of decorum and... fairness.
401,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Hey.
402,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't help you.
403,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So perilously direct.
404,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As Queen, I could command it."
405,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If I were one of your subjects.
406,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I could torture you so very slowly into compliance.
407,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Her Majesty will do as she wishes. I'm not for turning.
408,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, come now."
409,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everyone has their price.
410,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lord Peregrine of Nilfgaard.
411,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] Good chance, Peregrine, aah!"
412,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man 2] Go on, Lord Peregrine!"
413,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bagpipes blare]
414,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[loud laughter]
415,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bagpipes blare]
416,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Make another sound, Draig Bon-Dhu,"
417,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and I'll have your guts sewn into pipes and sent to your mother.
418,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Lord Peregrine] Queen Calanthe,"
419,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"my marriage to your daughter will unite the jewels of the north and south,"
420,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,forging an unbreakable alliance that none would dare cross.
421,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And...
422,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I am one of five brothers with no sisters.
423,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My potent seed inside Pavetta will produce the strongest of male heirs.
424,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Calanthe]  Cintra is indeed the jewel of the north,"
425,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"yet Nilfgaard remains the shit rag of the south, and that's saying something!"
426,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter and jeering]
427,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Tell me, is it true you drink piss water and feast on your own young?"
428,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[laughter and applause]
429,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nilfgaardian kings don't remain kings for long.
430,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who will take the Usurper's crown? You?
431,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How long will you last?
432,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A year? A month? A day?

439,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I mean, I'm just a womb to him."
440,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No more than a fleshy contraption for squeezing out heirs.
441,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bastard cares more about his hounds than he does me.
442,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take her.
443,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shh.
444,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[baby gurgling]
445,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why don't you stay in Lyria? Keep me company.
446,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"As soon as I've delivered Your Majesty safely back to court,"
447,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm afraid I must return to Aedirn.
448,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I envy you. Truly.
449,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A king's mage.

454,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I love...
455,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that I traded everything to get my seat at court.
456,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I love that I believed that it would all be worth it,"
457,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,that this would be my legacy.
458,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The greatest mage to have ever graced a court.
459,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And I really, really love..."
460,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"that instead, I've gotten to spend the last..."
461,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,three decades
462,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,cleaning up stupid political messes.
463,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Glorified royal arse wiper.
464,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
465,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I have it far worse.
466,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"People look at you for who you are, not for what you can give them."
467,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You made the right choice, giving all that nonsense up."
468,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"To this baby, I am the whole world."
469,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If only it weren't so boring.

501,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,not a brigand.
502,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What are you saying?
503,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He was paid to kill you.
504,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What?
505,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why?
506,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It appears you've run out of chances to provide your King a male heir.
507,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, he wouldn't."

592,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A knight...
593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of no renown...
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,from a backwater hamlet...
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who dares to enter my court
596,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,without revealing his face?
597,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I apologize, Your Majesty."
598,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A knight's oath prevents me from revealing my face
599,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,until the sounding of the twelfth bell.

618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,By the Law of Surprise.
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[swords being drawn]
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh...
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No!
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Kill them both!
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Law of Surprise has been called.
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You kill them...
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,kill me.
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[roars]
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My Queen...

632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Please.
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[baby cries]
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can give him a boy.
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take her instead.
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[creature chittering]

647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[murmuring]
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh.
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I told you to stay away.
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your Majesty...
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the witcher speaks the truth.
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was cursed as a young boy.
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My whole life a living misery
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"until the day that I saved your husband, King Roegner, from a certain death."
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"By tradition,"
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I chose the Law of Surprise as payment.
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whatever windfall he came home to find...
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,would be mine.
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Oh, the stupid bastard."
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Better you had let him die!
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Geralt] You knew he'd come,"
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and you pushed me to kill him.
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And you...
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,carousing with the beast that swindled your stupid father!
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,'Tis no swindle.
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Asking for payment with the Law of Surprise
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is as old as mankind itself.
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Don't lecture me, Eist."
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's an honest gamble.
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As likely to be rewarded with a bumper crop
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,as a newborn pup.
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or...
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,a child of surprise.
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,He could not know.
675,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny has determined the surprise be Pavetta.
676,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When I heard that King Roegner had returned to find a child on the way...
677,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I abandoned all thought of claiming the Law of Surprise.
678,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I knew...
679,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I knew no woman would ever accept me like this.
680,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And so I waited.
681,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I waited until the twelfth bell when the curse breaks.
682,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I never intended to meet her.
683,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just to watch from afar.
684,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Until destiny intervened...
685,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and our hearts collided.
686,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And at dawn, I awoke with her in my arms and me..."
687,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,like this.
688,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Who are we to challenge destiny?
689,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Life was saved, debt must be paid,"
690,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or the whole order of the world falls apart.
691,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Mousesack] Honor destiny's wish,"
692,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,or unleash its wrath upon us.
693,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is no us!
694,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I bow to no law made by men who never bore a child!
695,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is there not a man amongst you who does not cower before destiny?
696,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You, Witcher..."
697,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,who has known monsters of every fang and claw...
698,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,are you afraid too?
699,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
700,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I've seen mothers lash themselves raw over the death of a child,"
701,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"believing they crossed destiny,"
702,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,ignoring the stench
703,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,of the 50 other children in the plague cart outside.
704,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny...
705,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,helps people believe there's an order to this horseshit.
706,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There isn't.
707,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But a promise made must be honored.
708,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,As true for a commoner...
709,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,as it is for a queen.
710,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
711,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I love Duny, Mother."
712,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will marry him.
713,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will finally be free.
714,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Here is your destiny.
715,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No!
716,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"My Queen, are you hurt?"
717,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[speaking Elder]
718,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind howling]
719,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispered chanting in Elder]
720,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispering voices overlapping]
721,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chanting continuing]
722,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yells]
723,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Pavetta gasps]
724,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
725,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
726,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
727,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
728,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you believe in destiny now?
729,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
730,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
731,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I thought your grandmother's gift had skipped you...
732,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,as it did me.
733,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It seems I was wrong.
734,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,About so many things.
735,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny has spoken!
736,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And I have listened.
737,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Law of Surprise will be honored.
738,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pavetta will marry...
739,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lord Urcheon.
740,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[murmuring]
741,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"React poorly,"
742,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and you won't just face the Lioness,"
743,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you will be facing the sea hounds of Skellige.
744,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because Queen Calanthe...
745,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,has agreed to my proposal of marriage.
746,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There will be two vows here tonight!
747,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I assume that's agreeable.
748,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Delightful.
749,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No!
750,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[swords clashing]
751,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting]
752,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horses neighing]
753,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[explosions]
754,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[women screaming]
755,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
756,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dara?
757,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
758,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Dara?
759,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I drank the waters.
760,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's gonna be okay.
761,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's going to be okay?
762,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Everything.
763,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Leave your past behind.
764,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Join us.
765,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Drink and forget.
766,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why isn't it working?
767,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come.
768,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shan-Kayan calls to you.
769,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[bird calling]
770,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Which one of us are you here for?
771,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm sorry you didn't have a life.
772,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"But if truth be told, you're not missing much."
773,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I know it's easy for me to say with warm breath in my lungs,"
774,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and you with nothing.
775,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Still... what would you have had?
776,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Parents?
777,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, they're the ones who wrote your last act,"
778,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,so not much lost there.
779,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Friends?
780,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Most likely fair weather.
781,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Lovers?
782,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fun for a bit, I'll admit, but all eventually disappoint."
783,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And let's face it,"
784,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you're a girl.
785,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Your mother was right about one thing.
786,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're just vessels.
787,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"And even when we're told we're special,"
788,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"as I was,"
789,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"as you would've been,"
790,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,we're still just vessels...
791,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,for them to take...
792,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and take...
793,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,until we're empty...
794,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and alone.
795,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
796,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, count yourself lucky."
797,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've cheated the game and won without even knowing it.
798,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
799,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sleep well.
800,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pavetta.
801,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Duny.
802,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With my blessing...
803,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I thee bind.
804,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
805,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[barks]
806,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunting]
807,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[growling]
808,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
809,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[growling and moaning]
810,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wheezes]
811,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
812,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The twelfth bell has not yet rung.
813,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What has happened?
814,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I think your blessing of this marriage...
815,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,has fulfilled a destiny.
816,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The curse has been lifted.
817,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whew! [laughs]
818,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I think this has the makings of my greatest ballad yet.
819,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,If you're alive in the morning. Don't...
820,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,grope for trout in any peculiar rivers until dawn.
821,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, wait! Wait."
822,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You saved my life.
823,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I must repay you.
824,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've proven yourself to be the kind of man who would do the same.
825,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want nothing.
826,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, please."
827,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Please, Geralt of Rivia, do not feel like you're doing me a service."
828,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I cannot start a new life in the shadow of a life debt.
829,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fine.
830,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I...
831,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"claim the tradition as you have,"
832,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the Law of Surprise.
833,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Give me that which you already have but do not know.
834,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Calanthe] No!
835,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What have you done, Witcher?"
836,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fear not, Your Majesty,"
837,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"if I am seen in your kingdom again, it'll be to kill a real monster,"
838,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,not lay claim to a crop or a new pup.
839,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Destiny can go fu--
840,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Pavetta?
841,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you...
842,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Oh...
843,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fuck.
844,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Clearly the girl has access to immense primal power.
845,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yeah, and with no idea how to control it."
846,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm gonna stay.
847,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Guide her.
848,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
849,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're a good man, Mousesack."
850,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should stay too.
851,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This has been enough partying for me.
852,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm getting out of here.
853,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Alone.
854,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're bound to this now, Geralt."
855,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Whether you like it or not.
856,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not for changing.
857,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know me better than that.
858,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Yes, I do, but you can't outrun destiny just because you're terrified of it."
859,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's coming, Geralt."
860,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not believing won't change that.
861,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Bullshit.
862,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This was just a girl using her magic to stop her mother from gutting her lover.
863,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothing more.
864,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So you say.
865,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But the bond that will come into being between you
866,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and this child...
867,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"when it is born, will be extraordinary."
868,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you dismiss it, leave without claiming this..."
869,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"child surprise,"
870,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you will surely unleash true calamity upon us all.
871,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'll take that chance.
872,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
873,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mind yourself.
874,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,True words are rare birds in courts like this.
875,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Watch for daggers in your back.
876,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Or, more likely, poison."
877,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Be careful, old friend."
878,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
879,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Queen Calanthe.
880,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mistress, I've found her!"
881,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
882,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is it working?
883,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Calanthe's progeny is in Brokilon Forest.
884,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We can spare ten thousand men to take it, sir."
885,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Maybe 12.
886,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Shut up!
887,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Armies are not the way into Brokilon Forest.
888,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Damn it!
889,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
890,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Come on, get moving!"
891,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelps]
892,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whispering voices]
893,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You must drink from the source.
894,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasps]
895,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"What are you, child?"
