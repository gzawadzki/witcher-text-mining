0,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] Where would you be headin', little thief?"
1,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Geralt] I will take her, protect her,"
2,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and bring her back unharmed, I promise you that."
3,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse nickers]
4,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
5,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Roach whinnies]
6,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ill winds follow grave robbers.
7,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I was a robber, I'd be taking their belongings, Butcher."
8,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If I was a butcher, you'd be amongst the corpses."
9,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was goin' home to my family when I came upon these poor souls.
10,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cintran refugees. Dead at least a week.
11,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now they're a feast for the crows.
12,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're not crows.
13,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[flies buzzing]
14,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Wolves?
15,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No.
16,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With the hands of two, I could move quicker."
17,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The only thing you should do quickly is flee.
18,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
19,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Geralt] Come on, Roach, back to Kaer Morhen."
20,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Don't leave!
21,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Look at these people.
22,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Innocent people, killed for what?"
23,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,So Nilfgaard can have more land?
24,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
25,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We owe it to 'em to do better.
26,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm not better.
27,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
28,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
29,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[hissing]
30,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[yelling]
31,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screaming]
32,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sword slashes]
33,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[creature snarls]
34,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
35,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go home.
36,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can help.
37,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,One bite will kill you.
38,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Or you.
39,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Go... home!
40,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All right... [grunting]
41,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[flies buzzing]
42,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exhales]
43,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[buzzing intensifies]
44,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screeching and growling]
45,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
46,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarling]
47,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarls]
48,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarling]
49,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[panting]
50,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
51,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Fuck.
52,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
53,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
54,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
55,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Not a happy ever after, after all."
56,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A fitting end...
57,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"huh, Roach?"
58,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[woman] Come on, girl."
59,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Get up now.
60,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[flies buzzing]
61,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Ciri shuddering]
62,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let's get you out of here.
63,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What happened?
64,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They came for me.
65,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[woman] Well, then..."
66,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,they got what they deserved.
67,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're safe now.
68,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's okay.
69,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's okay.
70,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Let me take you home, girl. Something's in the air."
71,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[upbeat music playing]
72,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yennefer] There are, what, 60 of us? And we're the saviors of the Continent?"
73,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, the good news is there's only one way to move north:"
74,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,through Sodden Hill.
75,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must get to the Elven keep that guards it before Nilfgaard does.
76,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When is that?
77,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,My sources say the general's moving troops to the Yaruga Valley.
78,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're two days away.
79,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If we cut them off at the choke hold,"
80,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,we can still stop the Empire's progress.
81,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have sent word to the Northern Kingdoms.
82,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Temeria and Kaedwen will join us to defend their lands.
83,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,When is that?
84,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Within two days. Hopefully.
85,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will fortify the keep until they arrive.
86,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's the strategy.
87,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,A military strategy.
88,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're mages. Damn powerful ones.
89,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting in distance]
90,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Does Nilfgaard really believe they can take the whole Continent?
91,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They've been collecting soldiers,"
92,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,occupying territories...
93,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,letting loose their beliefs like an epidemic.
94,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Istredd was telling me.
95,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You saw Is?
96,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I saw it first hand in Nazair.
97,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Nilfgaard take people down to their worst,"
98,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,then give them something to cling to.
99,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Even if it's shitty ale.
100,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's why we're here.
101,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Because sometimes it's not shitty ale.
102,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Sometimes it's a bed in a pigpen.
103,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You have to make a choice to fight back.
104,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If Nilfgaard wanted to take the North,"
105,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,why would they expose themselves by sacking Cintra first?
106,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why wouldn't they just push through Sodden and surprise everyone?
107,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First, she shuns the military, now she's a military expert."
108,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"First, he speaks to her as though she's not there,"
109,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and then he loses a limb.
110,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
111,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're a talented mage.
112,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"An asset, to be sure."
113,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Despite being a...
114,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,An inconvenient arsehole?
115,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I couldn't have said it better myself.
116,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why did you come?
117,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] We've been walking for hours
118,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and you still haven't answered my question.
119,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Vilgefortz] If my military experience has taught me anything,"
120,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"it's that the bigger picture's left for history,"
121,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,which makes our task very clear:
122,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"hold Sodden, save the Continent."
123,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you in?
124,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is this what we're protecting?
125,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Tissaia] For hundreds of years,"
126,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,this keep has guarded the narrowest parts of the Yaruga River.
127,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Now it's the only thing standing between Nilfgaard and the North.
128,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] These people, they have been pushed here from their homes."
129,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They've seen the scorched earth,"
130,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the fields of corpses stretching between Gemmera and this river.
131,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Such cruelty.
132,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's Nilfgaard's way.
133,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's nothing like a higher purpose to permit men to do the unspeakable.
134,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] But it's all any of us have left.
135,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have to defend it.
136,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That's heroic.
137,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,And stupid.
138,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Take the children and hide before they get here.
139,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There is no more hiding from Nilfgaard.
140,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They have come from beyond the mountains to destroy the world.
141,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You still believe it can be saved?
142,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I suppose I do.
143,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With some help.
144,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[people clamoring]
145,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chanting in Elder]
146,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[continues chanting]
147,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[troops marching]
148,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horses neighing]
149,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chatter]
150,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[melancholy tune playing on rebec]
151,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] One here, on the east gate."
152,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is this all we have?
153,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Aye.
154,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm afraid so.
155,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We tried to get more fletchin', but..."
156,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Nilfgaard's blocked the roads,"
157,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,taken everythin' from us.
158,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Nothin' left to do but wait for 'em to attack.
159,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
160,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yennefer] You could be down there,"
161,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,with the others.
162,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] No.
163,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't.
164,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I lost my farm not a sennight ago...
165,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to soldiers who...
166,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,claimed it belonged to them.
167,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Took all me sucklin's, the bastards."
168,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I raised 'em,"
169,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,all on me own after me husband died.
170,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But now I have to fight back.
171,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whooshing]
172,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rustling]
173,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I wish I could do that.
174,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's magic.
175,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not real.
176,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[indistinct chatter and laughing]
177,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[baby crying]
178,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is Vilgefortz to be our new daddy?
179,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You did time in Temeria.
180,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you believe King Foltest will bring the Northern armies?
181,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Triss] I know he will.
182,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,His daughter was cursed. A striga.
183,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I guess I was the only one who didn't see her as a lost cause.
184,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You saved her?
185,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, we did."
186,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I enlisted a witcher.
187,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Geralt of Rivia.
188,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I often wonder where fate took him.
189,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Somewhere unpleasant, I'm sure."
190,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You should be wary of his kind.
191,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,They're so often disappointing.
192,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Tissaia] The ale won't disappoint.
193,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We should enjoy it while we can.
194,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's the first thing Nilfgaard will destroy.
195,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Must you always be so fatalistic?
196,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's only appropriate,"
197,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,seeing as we might die.
198,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,All the more reason to live tonight.
199,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Mmm. Like you.
200,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[both chuckle]
201,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"So, are you ready?"
202,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,To die?
203,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yes.
204,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've lived two or three lifetimes already.
205,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you haven't been satisfied in any of them.
206,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've tried.
207,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But I've no legacy to leave behind.
208,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No family.
209,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's time to accept that life has no more to give.
210,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You still have so much left to give.
211,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horses neighing]
212,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[weapons clattering]
213,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting]
214,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fifty thousand of our soldiers are marching from Cintra, sir."
215,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Cahir] I know.
216,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"We wipe out the keep,"
217,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"and when the General's forces arrive, they push through to the North."
218,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Cahir] And if it's too late?
219,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Fringilla, tell him he cannot possibly take Temeria alone."
220,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Cahir] Tell him he cannot possibly understand the stakes at play.
221,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The Brotherhood... they're here.
222,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Our scouts just spotted them,"
223,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,fortifying the keep.
224,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must move.
225,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How many?
226,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We don't know.
227,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[field marshal] We must wait.
228,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It is one thing to destroy a few peasant insurgents,"
229,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but we cannot combat unknown magic.
230,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have magic too.
231,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Without rules or restrictions.
232,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I will personally deplete them
233,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,until they are empty...
234,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,and powerless.
235,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Cahir, if the report from the trading post is true,"
236,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Cirilla may already be across the Yaruga.
237,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,This...
238,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is our chance...
239,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,to honor the White Flame.
240,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[field marshal]  Sir, forget Princess Cirilla."
241,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"With the General, we can take the Continent."
242,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Cahir] Enough!
243,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will not lose her.
244,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Test the Brotherhood's defenses.
245,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[boy] Where did you come from, anyway?"
246,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You tryin' to outrun the war like the rest of them? [scoffs]
247,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Refugees have been headin' this way for weeks now.
248,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Mum's a bleedin' heart, takin' you in."
249,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Are you dumb or somethin'?
250,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Why don't you talk?
251,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ow.
252,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Can't you see she's been through hell?
253,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,She's not here to take chores off your lazy hands.
254,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If you stay, think you could teach him some manners?"
255,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles]
256,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[distant rumbling]
257,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman gasps]
258,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse whinnies]
259,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[boy] Nilfgaard.
260,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs] They're here.
261,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low thumping]
262,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whistling]
263,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[men shouting]
264,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
265,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[screeching]
266,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
267,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[people screaming]
268,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
269,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Again.
270,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rustling]
271,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crackling]
272,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Get up! Everyone up!
273,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[people clamoring]
274,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] Move!
275,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crackling]
276,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[rumbling]
277,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[air whooshing]
278,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low rumbling]
279,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla] Draw the mages out.
280,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We will not lose to them.
281,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[exhales]
282,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[crows cawing]
283,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Vilgefortz] Stay low. We don't know what other tricks they may have.
284,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Triss] Maybe it's over.
285,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"No, Fringilla's just getting started."
286,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Sabrina] It hasn't been two days yet.
287,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How is Nilfgaard's army here already?
288,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Doesn't matter. We can't wait for the Northern Kingdoms.
289,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We have to fight.
290,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There are only 22 of us now.
291,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Those cowards fled after tonight's attack, but I'm not goin' anywhere."
292,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I've lived enough.
293,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[wind whooshing]
294,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"They're coming. We must move. The ten of you, to the field. Go!"
295,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sabrina, you take the villagers to the artillery room."
296,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Triss, come with me."
297,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Sabrina] This way! Follow me!
298,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Clear the battlement!
299,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Keep watch on the tower.
300,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The tower?
301,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Reserve your chaos.
302,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[horse neighing]
303,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] I don't like the look of this mist, Butcher."
304,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not natural.
305,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[distorted screeching]
306,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] Hey, careful now."
307,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts]
308,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Easy does it.
309,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[whooshing]
310,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You got bit, Butcher."
311,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You're delirious, but you're not dead."
312,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[snarls echoing]
313,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Not on my watch!
314,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Hey, come on now, be still, I said."
315,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We're goin' to my farm.
316,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just as soon as these poor old horses can take us there.
317,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You must stay awake, though."
318,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Butcher, you hear me?"
319,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Don't you go to sleep now, whatever you do!"
320,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[boy] Ma?
321,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ma?
322,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ma?
323,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[growling]
324,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Back, you beast. I'll kill you and take your treasure."
325,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Do not fear, Princess."
326,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] Dinner time.
327,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[boy] Someday I'll make you a necklace of dragon teeth.
328,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The prettiest necklace ever.
329,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] No.
330,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We must live and let live.
331,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,What's that mean?
332,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] It's our code.
333,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[man] Hey, Butcher."
334,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] We have to cling to something.
335,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"If we don't,"
336,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,the world descends into chaos.
337,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Ma...
338,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[low growl]
339,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Borch] It's magic.
340,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's not real.
341,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man] Grab your bows. Keep your head down.
342,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[man 2] Ready yourselves!
343,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Let's do this.
344,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Right.

577,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[Yennefer] If you can hear me,"
578,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you need to get to the front line.
579,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,More Nilfgaardians are coming to the woods.
580,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We can't give up.
581,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,We can still fight.

583,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
584,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Fringilla] You don't need  to fight anymore.
585,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You have never stopped searching.

587,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's here.
588,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,With Nilfgaard.

593,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer softly] Is anyone out there?
594,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is anyone still alive?
595,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Is anyone still alive?

612,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[groans]
613,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts and groans]
614,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
615,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[gasping]
616,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] You're not dead.
617,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You've merely woken.
618,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tastes like juniper with--
619,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Burdock, yes."
620,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Gangrene was setting in.
621,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I needed to neutralize the toxins.
622,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't move.
623,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's...
624,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,magic...
625,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,in the air.
626,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"[echoing] Your wound was troublesome, Geralt."
627,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you will be all right.
628,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
629,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You know my name.
630,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're in my head.
631,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You're listening.
632,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm a sorceress.
633,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you knew that already.
634,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You were saved by your pulse.
635,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Four times slower than a normal man's.
636,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I'm a witcher.
637,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But you knew that already too.
638,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you.
639,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Thank you for saving me.
640,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Most mages are occupied at the battle raging in Sodden,"
641,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,but I heard a merchant's cry for help and...
642,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,it's my profession.
643,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The only thing I've ever been good at.
644,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"I'm glad our paths crossed, then."
645,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] People linked by destiny will always find each other.
646,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,People linked by destiny will always find each other.
647,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Ma?
648,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[woman] Don't move.
649,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Come closer.
650,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I want you to look at me.
651,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How do you like my eyes?
652,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Do you know, Visenna,"
653,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,what they do to a witcher to improve his eyes?
654,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Stop it.
655,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Do you know that it doesn't always work?
656,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Stop it, Geralt."
657,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You don't get to use that name.
658,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Vesemir gave me that name.
659,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I need to know why.
660,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Visenna] No answer will give you what you want.
661,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Three...
662,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,out of ten boys survive the trial.
663,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Tell me...
664,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,at least...
665,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,you didn't know this before you left me on his doorstep?
666,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's time to sleep.
667,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,There's valerian in the medicines.
668,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[sighs]
669,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You trusted destiny
670,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,rather than trying to find me yourself.
671,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Don't ask any more questions.
672,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Why?
673,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Visenna] The answers will only hurt us both.
674,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"It's time to move on, Geralt."
675,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,It's time for you to find what you let go of.
676,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[breathing heavily]
677,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[softly] Find her.
678,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[echos] Find her...
679,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I was just a dream.
680,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Geralt] Please don't go.
681,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Sleep, Sir Geralt."
682,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Visenna!
683,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Visenna] Find her!
684,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,No! [gasps]
685,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Where'd she go?
686,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,The woman.
687,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[chuckles] Which one?
688,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,You called out for so many.
689,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts] How far from your home to the battlefield?
690,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Huh?
691,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[grunts] To Sodden?
692,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,How far? [grunts]
693,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Well, it's an hour with a swift enough horse."
694,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, I'm, uh..."
695,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"You know, I'm just a simple merchant."
696,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,I can't repay you for saving my life.
697,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,But what I can offer you...
698,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,is the Law of Surprise.
699,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,That which I have but don't know.
700,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Just give me an ale and consider your debt paid.
701,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,"Now, can we go?"
702,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[soldiers yelling]
703,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,[Yennefer] You're alive!
704,1,1,A Grain of Truth,,Yennefer.
